                    versions.\n\nTo use this, make a field which has RawExtension
                    as its type in your external, versioned struct, and Object in
                    your internal struct. You also need to register your various plugin
                    types.\n\n// Internal package: type MyAPIObject struct {\n\truntime.TypeMeta
                    `json:\",inline\"`\n\tMyPlugin runtime.Object `json:\"myPlugin\"`\n}
                    type PluginA struct {\n\tAOption string `json:\"aOption\"`\n}\n\n//
                    External package: type MyAPIObject struct {\n\truntime.TypeMeta
                    `json:\",inline\"`\n\tMyPlugin runtime.RawExtension `json:\"myPlugin\"`\n}
                    type PluginA struct {\n\tAOption string `json:\"aOption\"`\n}\n\n//
                    On the wire, the JSON will look something like this: {\n\t\"kind\":\"MyAPIObject\",\n\t\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\n\t\"myPlugin\":
                    {\n\t\t\"kind\":\"PluginA\",\n\t\t\"aOption\":\"foo\",\n\t},\n}\n\nSo
                    what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the
                    serialized data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the
                    raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy
                    (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package's
                    DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack
                    the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object
                    type, and storing it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the
                    object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown object will be
                    created and stored.)"
