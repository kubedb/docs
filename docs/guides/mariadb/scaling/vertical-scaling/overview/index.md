# MariaDB Vertical Scaling

This guide will give an overview on how KubeDB Ops Manager vertically scales up `MariaDB`.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MariaDB](/docs/guides/mariadb/concepts/mariadb/)
  - [MariaDBOpsRequest](/docs/guides/mariadb/concepts/opsrequest/)

## How Horizontal Scaling Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB Ops Manager scales up or down `MariaDB` database components. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The vertical scaling process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `MariaDB` Custom Resource (CR).

2. `KubeDB` Community operator watches the `MariaDB` CR.

3. When the operator finds a `MariaDB` CR, it creates required number of `StatefulSets` and related necessary stuff like secrets, services, etc.

4. Then, in order to update the resources(for example `CPU`, `Memory` etc.) of the `MariaDB` database the user creates a `MariaDBOpsRequest` CR with desired information.

5. `KubeDB` Enterprise operator watches the `MariaDBOpsRequest` CR.

6. When it finds a `MariaDBOpsRequest` CR, it halts the `MariaDB` object which is referred from the `MariaDBOpsRequest`. So, the `KubeDB` Community operator doesn't perform any operations on the `MariaDB` object during the vertical scaling process.  

7. Then the `KubeDB` Enterprise operator will update resources of the StatefulSet Pods to reach desired state.

8. After the successful update of the resources of the StatefulSet's replica, the `KubeDB` Enterprise operator updates the `MariaDB` object to reflect the updated state.

9. After the successful update  of the `MariaDB` resources, the `KubeDB` Enterprise operator resumes the `MariaDB` object so that the `KubeDB` Community operator resumes its usual operations.

In the next docs, we are going to show a step by step guide on updating resources of MariaDB database using `MariaDBOpsRequest` CRD.
