# RedisOpsRequest 

## What is RedisOpsRequest

`RedisOpsRequest` is a Kubernetes `Custom Resource Definitions` (CRD). It provides declarative configuration for [Redis](https://www.redis.io/) administrative operations like database version upgrading, horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, etc. in a Kubernetes native way.

## RedisOpsRequest CRD Specifications

Like any official Kubernetes resource, a `RedisOpsRequest` has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta`, `Spec` and `Status` sections.

Here, some sample `RedisOpsRequest` CRs for different administrative operations is given below,

Sample `RedisOpsRequest` for upgrading database:

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: RedisOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: upgrade-version
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: UpdateVersion
  databaseRef:
    name: standalone-redis
  upgrade:
    targetVersion: 7.0.5
```

Sample `RedisOpsRequest` for horizontal scaling:

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: RedisOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: up-horizontal-redis-ops
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: HorizontalScaling
  databaseRef:
    name: redis-cluster
  horizontalScaling:
    master: 5
    replicas: 2 
```


## What is RedisSentinelOpsRequest

`RedisSentinelOpsRequest` is a Kubernetes `Custom Resource Definitions` (CRD). It provides declarative configuration for [Redis](https://www.redis.io/) administrative operations like database version upgrading, horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, reconfiguring TLS etc. in a Kubernetes native way.
The spec in `RedisOpsRequest` and `RedisSentinelOpsRequest` similar which will be described below.

Sample `RedisSentinelOpsRequest` for vertical scaling
```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: RedisSentinelOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: redisops-vertical
  namespace: omed
spec:
  type: VerticalScaling
  databaseRef:
    name: sentinel-tls
  verticalScaling:
    redissentinel:
      requests:
        memory: "300Mi"
        cpu: "200m"
      limits:
        memory: "800Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

Here, we are going to describe the various sections of `RedisOpsRequest` and `RedisSentinelOpsRequest` CR .

### RedisOpsRequest `Spec`

A `RedisOpsRequest` object has the following fields in the `spec` section.

#### spec.databaseRef

`spec.databaseRef` is a required field that point to the [Redis](/docs/guides/redis/concepts/redis.md) object where the administrative operations will be applied. This field consists of the following sub-field:

- **spec.databaseRef.name :**  specifies the name of the [Redis](/docs/guides/redis/concepts/redis.md) object.

#### spec.type

`spec.type` specifies the kind of operation that will be applied to the database. Currently, the following types of operations are allowed in `RedisOpsRequest`.

- `UpdateVersion`
- `HorizontalScaling`
- `VerticalScaling`
- `VolumeExpansion`
- `Restart`
- `Reconfigure`
- `ReconfigureTLS`
- `ReplaceSentinel` (Only in Sentinel Mode)

`Reconfigure` and `ReplaceSentinel` ops request can not be done in `RedisSentinelOpsRequest`

>You can perform only one type of operation on a single `RedisOpsRequest` CR. For example, if you want to upgrade your database and scale up its replica then you have to create two separate `RedisOpsRequest`. At first, you have to create a `RedisOpsRequest` for upgrading. Once it is completed, then you can create another `RedisOpsRequest` for scaling. You should not create two `RedisOpsRequest` simultaneously.

#### spec.upgrade

If you want to upgrade your Redis version, you have to specify the `spec.upgrade`  section that specifies the desired version information. This field consists of the following sub-field:

- `spec.upgrade.targetVersion` refers to a [RedisVersion](/docs/guides/redis/concepts/catalog.md) CR that contains the Redis version information where you want to upgrade.

>You can only upgrade between Redis versions. KubeDB does not support downgrade for Redis.

#### spec.horizontalScaling

If you want to scale-up or scale-down your Redis cluster, you have to specify `spec.horizontalScaling` section. This field consists of the following sub-field:

- `spec.horizontalScaling.replicas` indicates the desired number of replicas for your Redis instance after scaling. For example, if your cluster currently has 4 replicas, and you want to add additional 2 replicas then you have to specify 6 in `spec.horizontalScaling.replicas` field. Similarly, if you want to remove one replicas, you have to specify 3  in `spec.horizontalScaling.replicas` field.
- `spec.horizontalScaling.master` indicates the desired number of master for your Redis cluster. It is only applicable for Cluster Mode.

#### spec.verticalScaling

`spec.verticalScaling` is a required field specifying the information of `Redis` resources like `cpu`, `memory` that will be scaled. This field consists of the following sub-fields:

- `spec.verticalScaling.redis` indicates the `Redis` server resources. It has the below structure:
  
```yaml
requests:
  memory: "200Mi"
  cpu: "0.1"
limits:
  memory: "300Mi"
  cpu: "0.2"
```

Here, when you specify the resource request for `Redis` container, the scheduler uses this information to decide which node to place the container of the Pod on and when you specify a resource limit for `Redis` container, the `kubelet` enforces those limits so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource than the limit you set. you can found more details from [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)

- `spec.verticalScaling.exporter` indicates the `exporter` container resources. It has the same structure as `spec.verticalScaling.redis` and you can scale the resource the same way as `redis` container.

>You can increase/decrease resources for both `redis` container and `exporter` container on a single `RedisOpsRequest` CR.

### spec.timeout
As we internally retry the ops request steps multiple times, This `timeout` field helps the users to specify the timeout for those steps of the ops request (in second).
If a step doesn't finish within the specified timeout, the ops request will result in failure.

### spec.apply
This field controls the execution of obsRequest depending on the database state. It has two supported values: `Always` & `IfReady`.
Use IfReady, if you want to process the opsRequest only when the database is Ready. And use Always, if you want to process the execution of opsReq irrespective of the Database state.


### RedisOpsRequest `Status`

After creating the Ops request `status` section is added in RedisOpsRequest CR. The yaml looks like following : 
```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: RedisOpsRequest
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1","kind":"RedisOpsRequest","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"redisops-vertical","namespace":"demo"},"spec":{"databaseRef":{"name":"standalone-redis"},"type":"VerticalScaling","verticalScaling":{"redis":{"limits":{"cpu":"500m","memory":"800Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"200m","memory":"300Mi"}}}}}

```

`.status` describes the current state of the `RedisOpsRequest` operation. It has the following fields:

#### status.phase

`status.phase` indicates the overall phase of the operation for this `RedisOpsRequest`. It can have the following three values:

| Phase      | Meaning                                                                          |

| Denied     | KubeDB has denied the operation requested in the RedisOpsRequest                 |

#### status.observedGeneration

`status.observedGeneration` shows the most recent generation observed by the `RedisOpsRequest` controller.

#### status.conditions

`status.conditions` is an array that specifies the conditions of different steps of `RedisOpsRequest` processing. Each condition entry has the following fields:
