# Upgrade version of Redis Cluster

This guide will show you how to use `KubeDB` Enterprise operator to upgrade the version of `Redis` cluster.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- Install `KubeDB` Community and Enterprise operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [Redis](/docs/guides/redis/concepts/redis.md)
  - [Redis Clustering](/docs/guides/redis/clustering/redis-cluster.md)
  - [RedisOpsRequest](/docs/guides/redis/concepts/opsrequest.md)
  - [Upgrading Overview](/docs/guides/redis/upgrading/overview.md)

To keep everything isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

> **Note:** YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/examples/redis](/docs/examples/redis) directory of [kubedb/docs](https://github.com/kube/docs) repository.

### Prepare Redis Cluster Database

Now, we are going to deploy a `Redis` cluster database with version `5.0.3-v1`.

### Deploy Redis cluster :

In this section, we are going to deploy a Redis cluster database. Then, in the next section we will upgrade the version of the database using `RedisOpsRequest` CRD. Below is the YAML of the `Redis` CR that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Redis
metadata:
  name: redis-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: 5.0.3-v1
  mode: Cluster
  cluster:
    master: 3
    replicas: 1
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

Let's create the `Redis` CR we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/redis/upgrading/rd-cluster.yaml
redis.kubedb.com/redis-cluster created
```

Now, wait until `redis-cluster` created has status `Ready`. i.e,

```bash
$ kubectl get rd -n demo
NAME              VERSION    STATUS   AGE
redis-cluster     5.0.3-v1   Ready    3m14s
```

We are now ready to apply the `RedisOpsRequest` CR to upgrade this database.

### Upgrade Redis Version

Here, we are going to upgrade `Redis` cluster from `5.0.3-v1` to `6.0.6`.

#### Create RedispsRequest:

In order to upgrade the cluster database, we have to create a `RedisOpsRequest` CR with your desired version that is supported by `KubeDB`. Below is the YAML of the `RedisOpsRequest` CR that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: RedisOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: upgrade-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: UpdateVersion
  databaseRef:
    name: redis-cluster
  upgrade:
    targetVersion: 6.0.6
```

Here,

- `spec.databaseRef.name` specifies that we are performing operation on `redis-cluster` Redis database.
- `spec.type` specifies that we are going to perform `Upgrade` on our database.
- `spec.upgrade.targetVersion` specifies the expected version of the database `6.0.6`.

Let's create the `RedisOpsRequest` CR we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/redis/upgrading/upgrade-cluster.yaml
redisopsrequest.ops.kubedb.com/upgrade-cluster created
```

#### Verify Redis version upgraded successfully :

If everything goes well, `KubeDB` Enterprise operator will update the image of `Redis` object and related `StatefulSets` and `Pods`.

Let's wait for `RedisOpsRequest` to be `Successful`.  Run the following command to watch `RedisOpsRequest` CR,

```bash
$ watch kubectl get redisopsrequest -n demo
Every 2.0s: kubectl get redisopsrequest -n demo
NAME                    TYPE      STATUS       AGE
upgrade-cluster         Upgrade   Successful   90s
```

We can see from the above output that the `RedisOpsRequest` has succeeded. If we describe the `RedisOpsRequest` we will get an overview of the steps that were followed to upgrade the database.

```bash
$ kubectl describe redisopsrequest -n demo upgrade-cluster

  Normal  Successful              62s   KubeDB Enterprise Operator  Successfully Completed the OpsRequest
```

Now, we are going to verify whether the `Redis` and the related `StatefulSets` their `Pods` have the new version image. Let's check,

```bash
$ kubectl get redis -n demo redis-cluster -o=jsonpath='{.spec.version}{"\n"}'
6.0.6

$ kubectl get statefulset -n demo redis-cluster-shard0 -o=jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}'
kubedb/redis:6.0.6

$ kubectl get pods -n demo redis-cluster-shard1-1 -o=jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}'
kubedb/redis:6.0.6

```

You can see from above, our `Redis` cluster database has been updated with the new version. So, the upgrade process is successfully completed.

## Cleaning Up

To clean up the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```bash
kubectl delete redis -n demo redis-cluster
kubectl delete redisopsrequest -n demo upgrade-cluster
```
