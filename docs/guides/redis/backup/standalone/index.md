# Backup and Restore Redis database using Stash

Stash 0.9.0+ supports backup and restoration of Redis databases. This guide will show you how you can backup and restore your Redis database with Stash.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube.
- Install KubeDB in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).
- Install Stash in your cluster following the steps [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/setup/install/stash/).
- Install Stash `kubectl` plugin following the steps [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/setup/install/kubectl-plugin/).
- If you are not familiar with how Stash backup and restore Redis databases, please check the following guide [here](/docs/guides/redis/backup/overview/index.md):


You have to be familiar with following custom resources:

- [AppBinding](/docs/guides/redis/concepts/appbinding.md)
- [Function](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/function/)
- [Task](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/task/)
- [BackupConfiguration](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration/)
- [RestoreSession](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/restoresession/)

To keep things isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial. Create the `demo` namespace if you haven't created it already.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Backup Redis

This section will demonstrate how to backup a Redis database. Here, we are going to deploy a Resis database using KubeDB. Then, we are going to backup this database into a GCS bucket. Finally, we are going to restore the backed-up data into another Redis database.

### Deploy Sample Redis Database

Let's deploy a sample Redis database and insert some data into it.

**Create Redis CRD:**

Below is the YAML of a sample Redis crd that we are going to create for this tutorial:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Redis
metadata:
  name: sample-redis
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: 6.0.20
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
```

Create the above `Redis` crd,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/redis/backup/standalone/examples/redis.yaml
redis.kubedb.com/sample-redis created
```

KubeDB will deploy a Redis database according to the above specification. It will also create the necessary secrets and services to access the database.

Let's check if the database is ready to use,

```bash
❯ kubectl get rd -n demo
NAME           VERSION   STATUS   AGE
sample-redis   6.0.20     Ready    58s
```

The database is `Ready`. Verify that KubeDB has created a Secret and a Service for this database using the following commands,

```bash
❯ kubectl get secret -n demo -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=sample-redis
NAME                  TYPE                       DATA   AGE
sample-redis-auth     kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      90s
sample-redis-config   Opaque                     1      90s


❯ kubectl get service -n demo -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=sample-redis
NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
sample-redis        ClusterIP   10.96.179.49   <none>        6379/TCP   116s
sample-redis-pods   ClusterIP   None           <none>        6379/TCP   116s
```

Here, we have to use the service `sample-redis` and secret `sample-redis-auth` to connect with the database.

### Insert Sample Data

Now, we are going to exec into the database pod and create some sample data. Kubedb has created a secret with access credentials. Let's find out the credentials from the Secret,

```yaml
❯ kubectl get secret -n demo sample-redis-auth -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: Q3l4cjttTzE3OEsuMCQ3Nw==
  username: cm9vdA==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-02-04T05:59:53Z"
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: database
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: sample-redis
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubedb.com
    app.kubernetes.io/name: redises.kubedb.com
  name: sample-redis-auth
  namespace: demo
  resourceVersion: "422952"
  uid: 58e3ac2b-51fe-4845-8bb1-959e51f52015
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
```

Here, we are going to use `password` to authenticate and insert the sample data.

At first, let's export the password as environment variables to make further commands re-usable.

```bash
export PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secrets -n demo sample-redis-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -d)
```

Now, let's exec into the database pod and insert some sample data,

```bash
❯ kubectl exec -it -n demo sample-redis-0 -- redis-cli -a $PASSWORD
Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.
# insert some key value pairs
127.0.0.1:6379> set key1 value1
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> set key2 value2
OK
# check the inserted data
127.0.0.1:6379> get key1
"value1"
127.0.0.1:6379> get key2
"value2"
# exit from redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> exit
```

We have successfully deployed a Redis database and inserted some sample data into it. Now, we are ready to backup our database into our desired backend using Stash.

## Prepare for Backup

In this section, we are going to prepare the necessary resources (i.e. database connection information, backend information, etc.) before backup.

### Verify Stash Redis Addon Installed

When you install the Stash, it automatically installs all the official database addons. Verify that it has installed the Redis addons using the following command.

```bash
$ kubectl get tasks.stash.appscode.com | grep redis
redis-backup-5.0.13            1h
redis-backup-6.2.5             1h
redis-restore-5.0.13           1h
redis-restore-6.2.5            1h
```

### Ensure AppBinding
Stash needs to know how to connect with the database. An `AppBinding` exactly provides this information. It holds the Service and Secret information of the database. You have to point to the respective `AppBinding` as a target of backup instead of the database itself.

Verify that the `AppBinding` has been created successfully using the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get appbindings -n demo
NAME              TYPE                  VERSION   AGE
sample-redis   kubedb.com/redis         6.0.20     2m54s
```

Let's check the YAML of the above `AppBinding`,

```bash
❯ kubectl get appbindings -n demo sample-redis -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: AppBinding
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: database
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: sample-redis
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubedb.com
    app.kubernetes.io/name: redises.kubedb.com
  name: sample-redis
  namespace: demo
  ...
clientConfig:
    service:
      name: sample-redis
      port: 6379
      scheme: redis
  parameters:
    apiVersion: config.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
    kind: RedisConfiguration
    stash:
      addon:
        backupTask:
          name: redis-backup-6.2.5
        restoreTask:
          name: redis-restore-6.2.5
  secret:
    name: sample-redis-auth
  type: kubedb.com/redis
  version: 6.0.20
```
Stash requires the following fields to set in AppBinding's `Spec` section.

- `spec.clientConfig.service.name` specifies the name of the service that connects to the database.
- `spec.secret` specifies the name of the secret that holds necessary credentials to access the database.
- `spec.parameters.stash` specifies the Stash Addons that will be used to backup and restore this database.
- `spec.type` specifies the types of the app that this AppBinding is pointing to. KubeDB generated AppBinding follows the following format: `<app group>/<app resource type>`.

We will use this `Appbinding` later for connecting into this database.

### Prepare Backend

We are going to store our backed up data into a GCS bucket. So, we need to create a Secret with GCS credentials and a `Repository` object with the bucket information. If you want to use a different backend, please read the respective backend configuration doc from [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/guides/backends/overview/).

**Create Storage Secret:**

At first, let's create a secret called `gcs-secret` with access credentials to our desired GCS bucket,

```bash
$ echo -n 'changeit' > RESTIC_PASSWORD
$ echo -n '<your-project-id>' > GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
$ cat downloaded-sa-key.json > GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
$ kubectl create secret generic -n demo gcs-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
secret/gcs-secret created
```

**Create Repository:**

Now, crete a `Repository` object with the information of your desired bucket. Below is the YAML of `Repository` object we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: gcs-repo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-testing
      prefix: /demo/redis/sample-redis
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
```

Let's create the `Repository` we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/redis/backup/standalone/examples/repository.yaml
repository.stash.appscode.com/gcs-repo created
```

Now, we are ready to backup our database into our GCS bucket.

### Backup

To schedule a backup, we have to create a `BackupConfiguration` object targeting the respective `AppBinding` of our desired database. Then Stash will create a CronJob to periodically backup the database.

#### Create BackupConfiguration

Below is the YAML for `BackupConfiguration` object we care going to use to backup the `sample-redis` database we have deployed earlier,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: sample-redis-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  repository:
    name: gcs-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: sample-redis
  retentionPolicy:
    name: keep-last-5
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

Here,

- `.spec.schedule` specifies that we want to backup the database at 5 minutes intervals.
- `.spec.repository.name` specifies the Repository CR name we have created earlier with backend information.
- `.spec.target.ref` refers to the AppBinding object that holds the connection information of our targeted database.
- `.spec.retentionPolicy` specifies a policy indicating how we want to cleanup the old backups.

Let's create the `BackupConfiguration` object we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/redis/backup/standalone/examples/backupconfiguration.yaml
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-redis-backup created
```

#### Verify Backup Setup Successful

If everything goes well, the phase of the `BackupConfiguration` should be `Ready`. The `Ready` phase indicates that the backup setup is successful. Let's verify the `Phase` of the BackupConfiguration,

```bash
$ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo
NAME                  TASK                 SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE      AGE
sample-redis-backup   redis-backup-6.2.5   */5 * * * *            Ready      11s
```

#### Verify CronJob

Stash will create a CronJob with the schedule specified in `spec.schedule` field of `BackupConfiguration` object.

Verify that the CronJob has been created using the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                               SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-redis-backup   */5 * * * *   False     0        <none>          14s
```

#### Wait for BackupSession

The `sample-redis-backup` CronJob will trigger a backup on each scheduled slot by creating a `BackupSession` object.

Now, wait for a schedule to appear. Run the following command to watch for a `BackupSession` object,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupsession -n demo -w
NAME                             INVOKER-TYPE          INVOKER-NAME          PHASE       DURATION          AGE
sample-redis-backup-1627490702   BackupConfiguration   sample-redis-backup                                 0s
sample-redis-backup-1627490702   BackupConfiguration   sample-redis-backup   Running                       0s
sample-redis-backup-1627490702   BackupConfiguration   sample-redis-backup   Succeeded   1m18.098555424s   78s
```

Here, the phase `Succeeded` means that the backup process has been completed successfully.

#### Verify Backup

Now, we are going to verify whether the backed up data is present in the backend or not. Once a backup is completed, Stash will update the respective `Repository` object to reflect the backup completion. Check that the repository `gcs-repo` has been updated by the following command,

```bash
$ kubectl get repository -n demo gcs-repo
NAME       INTEGRITY   SIZE        SNAPSHOT-COUNT   LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP   AGE
gcs-repo   true        1.327 MiB   1                60s                      8m
```

Now, if we navigate to the GCS bucket, we will see the backed up data has been stored in `demo/redis/sample-redis` directory as specified by `.spec.backend.gcs.prefix` field of the `Repository` object.
<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Backup data in GCS Bucket" src="/docs/guides/redis/backup/standalone/images/sample-redis-backup.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Backup data in GCS Bucket</figcaption>
</figure>


> Note: Stash keeps all the backed up data encrypted. So, data in the backend will not make any sense until they are decrypted.

## Restore Redis
If you have followed the previous sections properly, you should have a successful logical backup of your Redis database. Now, we are going to show how you can restore the database from the backed up data.

### Restore Into the Same Database

You can restore your data into the same database you have backed up from or into a different database in the same cluster or a different cluster. In this section, we are going to show you how to restore in the same database which may be necessary when you have accidentally deleted any data from the running database.

#### Temporarily Pause Backup

At first, let's stop taking any further backup of the database so that no backup runs after we delete the sample data. We are going to pause the `BackupConfiguration` object. Stash will stop taking any further backup when the `BackupConfiguration` is paused.

Let's pause the `sample-redis-backup` BackupConfiguration,
```bash
❯ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n demo sample-redis-backup --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": true}}'
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-redis-backup patched
```

Or you can use the Stash `kubectl` plugin to pause the `BackupConfiguration`,
```bash
❯ kubectl stash pause backup -n demo --backupconfig=sample-redis-backup
BackupConfiguration demo/sample-redis-backup has been paused successfully.
```

Verify that the `BackupConfiguration` has been paused,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo sample-redis-backup
NAME                  TASK                 SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
sample-redis-backup   redis-backup-6.2.5   */5 * * * *   true     Ready   4h47m
```

Notice the `PAUSED` column. Value `true` for this field means that the `BackupConfiguration` has been paused.

Stash will also suspend the respective CronJob.

```bash
❯ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                               SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-redis-backup   */5 * * * *   True      0        113s            4h48m
```

#### Simulate Disaster

Now, let's simulate an accidental deletion scenario. Here, we are going to exec into the database pod and delete the sample data we have inserted earlier.

```bash
❯ kubectl exec -it -n demo sample-redis-0 -- redis-cli -a $PASSWORD
Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.
# delete the sample data
127.0.0.1:6379> del key1 key2
(integer) 2
# verify that the sample data has been deleted
127.0.0.1:6379> get key1
(nil)
127.0.0.1:6379> get key2
(nil)
127.0.0.1:6379> exit
```

#### Create RestoreSession

To restore the database, you have to create a `RestoreSession` object pointing to the `AppBinding` of the targeted database.

Here, is the YAML of the `RestoreSession` object that we are going to use for restoring our `sample-redis` database.

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: RestoreSession
metadata:
  name: sample-redis-restore
  namespace: demo
spec:
  repository:
    name: gcs-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: sample-redis
  rules:
  - snapshots: [latest]
```

Here,

- `.spec.repository.name` specifies the Repository object that holds the backend information where our backed up data has been stored.
- `.spec.target.ref` refers to the respective AppBinding of the `sample-redis` database.
- `.spec.rules` specifies that we are restoring data from the latest backup snapshot of the database.

Let's create the `RestoreSession` object object we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/redis/backup/standalone/examples/restoresession.yaml
restoresession.stash.appscode.com/sample-redis-restore created
```

Once, you have created the `RestoreSession` object, Stash will create a restore Job. Run the following command to watch the phase of the `RestoreSession` object,

```bash
❯ kubectl get restoresession -n demo -w
NAME                   REPOSITORY   PHASE     DURATION          AGE
sample-redis-restore   gcs-repo     Running                     6s
sample-redis-restore   gcs-repo     Running                     16s
sample-redis-restore   gcs-repo     Succeeded                   16s
sample-redis-restore   gcs-repo     Succeeded   16.324570911s   16s
```

The `Succeeded` phase means that the restore process has been completed successfully.

#### Verify Restored Data

Now, let's exec into the database pod and verify whether data actual data has been restored or not,

```bash
❯ kubectl exec -it -n demo sample-redis-0 -- redis-cli -a $PASSWORD
Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.
127.0.0.1:6379> get key1
"value1"
127.0.0.1:6379> get key2
"value2"
127.0.0.1:6379> exit
```

Hence, we can see from the above output that the deleted data has been restored successfully from the backup.

#### Resume Backup

Since our data has been restored successfully we can now resume our usual backup process. Resume the `BackupConfiguration` using following command,
```bash
❯ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n demo sample-redis-backup --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": false}}'
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-redis-backup patched
```

Or you can use the Stash `kubectl` plugin to resume the `BackupConfiguration`
```bash
❯ kubectl stash resume -n demo --backupconfig=sample-redis-backup 
BackupConfiguration demo/sample-redis-backup has been resumed successfully.
```

Verify that the `BackupConfiguration` has been resumed,
```bash
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo sample-redis-backup
NAME                  TASK                 SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
sample-redis-backup   redis-backup-6.2.5   */5 * * * *   false    Ready   4h54m
```

Here,  `false` in the `PAUSED` column means the backup has been resume successfully. The CronJob also should be resumed now.

```bash
❯ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                               SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-redis-backup   */5 * * * *   False     0        3m24s           4h54m
```

Here, `False` in the `SUSPEND` column means the CronJob is no longer suspended and will trigger in the next schedule.

### Restore Into Different Database of the Same Namespace

If you want to restore the backed up data into a different database of the same namespace, you need to have another `AppBinding` pointing to the desired database. Then, you have to create the `RestoreSession` pointing to the new `AppBinding`.

### Restore Into Different Namespace

If you want to restore into a different namespace of the same cluster, you have to create the Repository, backend Secret, AppBinding, in the desired namespace. You can use [Stash kubectl plugin](https://stash.run/docs/latest/guides/cli/kubectl-plugin/) to easily copy the resources into a new namespace. Then, you have to create the `RestoreSession` object in the desired namespace pointing to the Repository, AppBinding of that namespace.

### Restore Into Different Cluster

If you want to restore into a different cluster, you have to install Stash in the desired cluster. Then, you have to install Stash Redis addon in that cluster too. Then, you have to create the Repository, backend Secret, AppBinding, in the desired cluster. Finally, you have to create the `RestoreSession` object in the desired cluster pointing to the Repository, AppBinding of that cluster.

## Cleanup

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```bash
kubectl delete -n demo backupconfiguration sample-redis-backup
kubectl delete -n demo restoresession sample-redis-restore
kubectl delete -n demo repository gcs-repo
# delete the database resources
kubectl delete redis sample-redis -n demo
#delete the namespace
kubectl delete ns demo
```
