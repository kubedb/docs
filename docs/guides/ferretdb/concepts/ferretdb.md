# FerretDB

## What is FerretDB

`FerretDB` is a Kubernetes `Custom Resource Definitions` (CRD). It provides declarative configuration for [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.com/) in a Kubernetes native way. You only need to describe the desired configuration in a `FerretDB`object, and the KubeDB operator will create Kubernetes objects in the desired state for you.

## FerretDB Spec

As with all other Kubernetes objects, a FerretDB needs `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields. It also needs a `.spec` section. Below is an example FerretDB object.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: FerretDB
metadata:
  name: ferretdb
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "1.23.0"
  replicas: 1
  healthChecker:
    failureThreshold: 3
    periodSeconds: 20
    timeoutSeconds: 10
  authSecret:
    name: ferretdb-auth
    externallyManaged: false
  backend:
    postgresRef:
      name: ha-postgres
      namespace: demo
    version: "13.13"
    linkedDB: "ferretdb"
    externallyManaged: false
  sslMode: requireSSL
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      apiGroup: cert-manager.io
      name: ferretdb-ca-issuer
      kind: Issuer
    certificates:
      - alias: server
        subject:
          organizations:
            - kubedb:server
        dnsNames:
          - localhost
        ipAddresses:
          - "127.0.0.1"
  monitor:
    agent: prometheus.io/operator
    prometheus:
      serviceMonitor:
        labels:
          release: prometheus
        interval: 10s
  deletionPolicy: WipeOut
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: ferretdb
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 1Gi
            requests:
              cpu: 200m
              memory: 256Mi
  serviceTemplates:
    - alias: primary
      spec:
        type: ClusterIP
        ports:
          - name: http
            port: 9999
```

### spec.version

`spec.version` is a required field specifying the name of the [FerretDBVersion](/docs/guides/ferretdb/concepts/catalog.md) crd where the docker images are specified. Currently, when you install KubeDB, it creates the following `FerretDBVersion` resources,

- `1.18.0`, `1.23.0`

### spec.replicas

`spec.replicas` the number of members in ferretdb replicaset.

KubeDB uses `PodDisruptionBudget` to ensure that majority of these replicas are available during [voluntary disruptions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/#voluntary-and-involuntary-disruptions) so that quorum is maintained.

### spec.healthChecker
It defines the attributes for the health checker.
- `spec.healthChecker.periodSeconds` specifies how often to perform the health check.
- `spec.healthChecker.timeoutSeconds` specifies the number of seconds after which the probe times out.
- `spec.healthChecker.failureThreshold` specifies minimum consecutive failures for the healthChecker to be considered failed.
- `spec.healthChecker.disableWriteCheck` specifies whether to disable the writeCheck or not.

### spec.authSecret

`spec.authSecret` is an optional field that points to a Secret used to hold credentials for `ferretdb`. If not set, KubeDB operator creates a new Secret `{ferretdb-object-name}-auth` for storing the password for `ferretdb` user for each FerretDB object.
As FerretDB use backend's authentication mechanisms till now, this secret is basically a copy of backend postgres.

We can use this field in 3 mode.
1. Using an external secret. In this case, You need to create an auth secret first with required fields, then specify the secret name when creating the FerretDB object using `spec.authSecret.name` & set `spec.authSecret.externallyManaged` to true.
```yaml
authSecret:
  name: <your-created-auth-secret-name>
  externallyManaged: true
```

2. Specifying the secret name only. In this case, You need to specify the secret name when creating the FerretDB object using `spec.authSecret.name`. `externallyManaged` is by default false.
```yaml
authSecret:
  name: <intended-auth-secret-name>
```

3. Let KubeDB do everything for you. In this case, no work for you.

AuthSecret contains a `user` key and a `password` key which contains the `username` and `password` respectively for `ferretdb` user.

Example:

```bash
$ kubectl create secret generic ferretdb-auth -n demo \
--from-literal=username=jhon \
--from-literal=password=O9xE1mZZDAdBTbrV
secret "ferretdb-auth" created
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: "O9xE1mZZDAdBTbrV"
  username: "jhon"
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ferretdb-auth
  namespace: demo
type: Opaque
```

Secrets provided by users are not managed by KubeDB, and therefore, won't be modified or garbage collected by the KubeDB operator (version 0.13.0 and higher).

### spec.backend

- `spec.backend.externallyManaged` represents how the backend will be managed. If its false, KubeDB will automatically create a KubeDB managed postgres. Otherwise you need refer a [AppBinding](/docs/guides/ferretdb/concepts/appbinding.md) name and namespace which represents information for external Postgres.
- `spec.backend.postgresRef` is a required field that points to the `appbinding` associated with the backend postgres. If the postgres is KubeDB managed an [AppBinding](/docs/guides/ferretdb/concepts/appbinding.md) will be created automatically upon creating the postgres. If the postgres is not KubeDB managed then you need to create an appbinding yourself. `spec.backend.postgresRef` takes the name (`spec.backend.postgresRef.Name`) of the appbinding and the namespace (`spec.backend.postgresRef.Namespace`) where the appbinding is created.
- `spec.backend.version` represents the version of backend postgres
- `spec.backend.linkedDB` represents in which database of backend postgres will be used by FerretDB to store data

### spec.sslMode

Enables TLS/SSL or mixed TLS/SSL used for all network connections. The value of [`sslMode`](https://docs.ferretdb.io/security/tls-connections/) field can be one of the following:

|    Value     | Description                                                                                                                    |
| :----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `disabled`  | The server does not use TLS/SSL.                                                                                               |
| `requireSSL` | The server uses and accepts only TLS/SSL encrypted connections.                                                                |

### spec.tls

`spec.tls` specifies the TLS/SSL configurations for the FerretDB. KubeDB uses [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) v1 api to provision and manage TLS certificates.

The following fields are configurable in the `spec.tls` section:

- `issuerRef` is a reference to the `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` CR of [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/) that will be used by `KubeDB` to generate necessary certificates.

    - `apiGroup` is the group name of the resource that is being referenced. Currently, the only supported value is `cert-manager.io`.
    - `kind` is the type of resource that is being referenced. KubeDB supports both `Issuer` and `ClusterIssuer` as values for this field.
    - `name` is the name of the resource (`Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer`) being referenced.

- `certificates` (optional) are a list of certificates used to configure the server and/or client certificate. It has the following fields:
    - `alias` represents the identifier of the certificate. It has the following possible value:
        - `server` is used for server certificate identification.
        - `client` is used for client certificate identification.
        - `metrics-exporter` is used for metrics exporter certificate identification.
    - `secretName` (optional) specifies the k8s secret name that holds the certificates.
      > This field is optional. If the user does not specify this field, the default secret name will be created in the following format: `<database-name>-<cert-alias>-cert`.

    - `subject` (optional) specifies an `X.509` distinguished name. It has the following possible field,
        - `organizations` (optional) are the list of different organization names to be used on the Certificate.
        - `organizationalUnits` (optional) are the list of different organization unit name to be used on the Certificate.
        - `countries` (optional) are the list of country names to be used on the Certificate.
        - `localities` (optional) are the list of locality names to be used on the Certificate.
        - `provinces` (optional) are the list of province names to be used on the Certificate.
        - `streetAddresses` (optional) are the list of a street address to be used on the Certificate.
        - `postalCodes` (optional) are the list of postal code to be used on the Certificate.
        - `serialNumber` (optional) is a serial number to be used on the Certificate.
          You can find more details from [Here](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/pkix/#Name)
    - `duration` (optional) is the period during which the certificate is valid.
    - `renewBefore` (optional) is a specifiable time before expiration duration.
    - `dnsNames` (optional) is a list of subject alt names to be used in the Certificate.
    - `ipAddresses` (optional) is a list of IP addresses to be used in the Certificate.
    - `uris` (optional) is a list of URI Subject Alternative Names to be set in the Certificate.
    - `emailAddresses` (optional) is a list of email Subject Alternative Names to be set in the Certificate.
    - `privateKey` (optional) specifies options to control private keys used for the Certificate.
    - `encoding` (optional) is the private key cryptography standards (PKCS) encoding for this certificate's private key to be encoded in. If provided, allowed values are "pkcs1" and "pkcs8" standing for PKCS#1 and PKCS#8, respectively. It defaults to PKCS#1 if not specified.

### spec.monitor

FerretDB managed by KubeDB can be monitored with builtin-Prometheus and Prometheus operator out-of-the-box. To learn more,

- [Monitor FerretDB with builtin Prometheus](/docs/guides/ferretdb/monitoring/using-builtin-prometheus.md)
- [Monitor FerretDB with Prometheus operator](/docs/guides/ferretdb/monitoring/using-prometheus-operator.md)

### spec.deletionPolicy

`deletionPolicy` gives flexibility whether to `nullify`(reject) the delete operation of `FerretDB` CR or which resources KubeDB should keep or delete when you delete `FerretDB` CR. KubeDB provides following four deletion policies:

- DoNotTerminate
- Delete
- WipeOut (`Default`)

When `deletionPolicy` is `DoNotTerminate`, KubeDB takes advantage of `ValidationWebhook` feature in Kubernetes 1.9.0 or later clusters to implement `DoNotTerminate` feature. If admission webhook is enabled, `DoNotTerminate` prevents users from deleting the database as long as the `spec.deletionPolicy` is set to `DoNotTerminate`.

Following table show what KubeDB does when you delete FerretDB CR for different deletion policies,

| Behavior                  | DoNotTerminate |    Delete    | WipeOut  |
|---------------------------| :------------: |:------------:| :------: |
| 1. Block Delete operation |    &#10003;    |   &#10007;   | &#10007; |
| 2. Delete PetSet          |    &#10007;    |   &#10003;   | &#10003; |
| 3. Delete Services        |    &#10007;    |   &#10003;   | &#10003; |
| 4. Delete Secrets         |    &#10007;    |   &#10007;   | &#10003; |

If you don't specify `spec.deletionPolicy` KubeDB uses `Delete` deletion policy by default.

### spec.podTemplate

KubeDB allows providing a template for pod through `spec.podTemplate`. KubeDB operator will pass the information provided in `spec.podTemplate` to the PetSet created for FerretDB.

KubeDB accept following fields to set in `spec.podTemplate:`

- metadata:
    - annotations (pod's annotation)
    - labels (pod's labels)
- controller:
    - annotations (statefulset's annotation)
    - labels (statefulset's labels)
- spec:
    - volumes
    - initContainers
    - containers
    - imagePullSecrets
    - nodeSelector
    - affinity
    - serviceAccountName
    - schedulerName
    - tolerations
    - priorityClassName
    - priority
    - securityContext
    - livenessProbe
    - readinessProbe
    - lifecycle

You can check out the full list [here](https://github.com/kmodules/offshoot-api/blob/39bf8b2/api/v2/types.go#L44-L279). Uses of some field of `spec.podTemplate` is described below,

#### spec.podTemplate.spec.nodeSelector

`spec.podTemplate.spec.nodeSelector` is an optional field that specifies a map of key-value pairs. For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the node must have each of the indicated key-value pairs as labels (it can have additional labels as well). To learn more, see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) .

#### spec.podTemplate.spec.resources

`spec.podTemplate.spec.resources` is an optional field. This can be used to request compute resources required by the database pods. To learn more, visit [here](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/).

### spec.serviceTemplates

You can also provide template for the services created by KubeDB operator for Kafka cluster through `spec.serviceTemplates`. This will allow you to set the type and other properties of the services.

KubeDB allows following fields to set in `spec.serviceTemplates`:
- `alias` represents the identifier of the service. It has the following possible value:
    - `stats` is used for the exporter service identification.
- metadata:
    - labels
    - annotations
- spec:
    - type
    - ports
    - clusterIP
    - externalIPs
    - loadBalancerIP
    - loadBalancerSourceRanges
    - externalTrafficPolicy
    - healthCheckNodePort
    - sessionAffinityConfig

See [here](https://github.com/kmodules/offshoot-api/blob/kubernetes-1.21.1/api/v1/types.go#L237) to understand these fields in detail.
