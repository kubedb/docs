# Elasticsearch Rotate TLS Recommendation

TLS certificate rotation in databases is essential for maintaining security, ensuring compliance, and preventing service disruptions. Regular rotation mitigates risks like certificate expiry and key compromise, adapts to evolving cryptographic standards, and maintains trust relationships with Certificate Authorities. It also enhances operational resilience by testing renewal processes and ensures smooth auditing and monitoring. To minimize risks and streamline the process, KubeDB provides ReconfigureTLS OpsRequest support. KubeDB Ops-manager generates Recommendation to rotate TLS certificates via this OpsRequest when their expiry is near.

`Recommendation` is a Kubernetes `Custom Resource Definitions` (CRD). It provides a declarative recommendation for KubeDB managed databases like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) and [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) in a Kubernetes native way. KubeDB generates Elasticsearch/Opensearch Rotate TLS recommendation regarding if:

- At least one of its certificateâ€™s lifespan is more than one month and less than one month remaining till expiry

- At least one of its certificates has one-third of its lifespan remaining till expiry.

Let's go through a demo to see `RotateTLS` recommendations being generated. First, get the available Elasticsearch versions provided by KubeDB.

Let's deploy an Elasticsearch cluster with version `xpack-8.15.0`. We are going to create a cluster topology with 2 master nodes, 3 data nodes and 2 ingest node. We also have to provide an available storageclass for each of the node types. Make sure to have an issuer/clusterIssuer to refer in the manifest. Though KubeDB managed elasticsearch supports TLS in both cert-manager provisioned and Operator provisioned ways, rotate tls only works when certificates are provisioned via cert-manager.

          requests:
            storage: 3Gi
        storageClassName: local-path
  version: xpack-8.15.0
```

Wait for a while till elasicsearch cluster gets into `Ready` state. Required time depends on image pulling and node's physical specifications.

```bash
$ kubectl get es elastic -n es -w
NAME      VERSION        STATUS         AGE
elastic   xpack-8.15.0   Provisioning   98s
elastic   xpack-8.15.0   Provisioning   5m43s
elastic   xpack-8.15.0   Provisioning   8m7s
.
.
.
elastic   xpack-8.15.0   Ready          10m
elastic   xpack-8.15.0   Ready          10m
```

Since,duration for client certificate is set as `1h20min`, it is expected that the recommendation engine will generate a rotate-auth recommendation at least after 54 minutes (two-third of lifespan) of the client certificate creation. Once generated you will get a similar recommendation as follows.

```bash
$ kubectl get recommendation -n es | grep rotate-tls
NAME                                              STATUS    OUTDATED     AGE
elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez       Pending     false      74s
```

The `Recommendation` custom resource will be named as `<DB-name>-x-<DB type>-x-<Recommendation type>-<random hash>`. Initially, the KubeDB `Supervisor` controller will mark the `Status` of this object to `Pending`. Let's check the complete Recommendation custom resource manifest:

```yaml
$ kubectl get recommendation -n es elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez -oyaml
apiVersion: supervisor.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Recommendation

    kind: ElasticsearchOpsRequest
    metadata:

      namespace: es
    spec:
      databaseRef:
        name: elastic
      tls:
        rotateCertificates: true
      type: ReconfigureTLS
    status: {}
  recommender:
    name: kubedb-ops-manager
  rules:
    failed: has(self.status) && has(self.status.phase) && self.status.phase == 'Failed'
    inProgress: has(self.status) && has(self.status.phase) && self.status.phase ==
      'Progressing'
    success: has(self.status) && has(self.status.phase) && self.status.phase == 'Successful'
  target:
    apiGroup: kubedb.com
    kind: Elasticsearch
    name: elastic
status:
  approvalStatus: Pending
  failedAttempt: 0
  outdated: false
  parallelism: Namespace
  phase: Pending
  reason: WaitingForApproval
```

In the generated Recommendation you will find a description, targeted db object, recommended operation or Ops-Request manifest, current status of the recommendation etc. Let's just focus on the recommendation description first.

```shell
$ kubectl get recommendation -n es elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez -o jsonpath='{.spec.operation}' | yq -y
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: ElasticsearchOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: rotate-tls
  namespace: es
spec:
  databaseRef:
    name: elastic
  tls:
    rotateCertificates: true
  type: ReconfigureTLS
status: {}
```

Let's check the status part of this recommendation.

```bash
$ kubectl get recommendation -n es elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez -o jsonpath='{.status}' | yq -y
approvalStatus: Pending
failedAttempt: 0
outdated: false
parallelism: Namespace
phase: Pending
reason: WaitingForApproval
```

Now, This recommendation can be approved and operation can be executed immediately by setting `ApprovalStatus` to `Approved` and Setting `approvedWindow` to `Immediate`. You can approve this easily through Appscode UI or edit it manually. Also, You can use kubectl CLI for this -

```bash
$ kubectl patch Recommendation elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez \
                  -n es \
                  --type merge \
                  --subresource='status' \
                  -p '{"status":{"approvalStatus":"Approved","approvedWindow":{"window":"Immediate"}}}'
recommendation.supervisor.appscode.com/elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez patched
```

Now, check the status part again. You will find a condition have appeared which says `OpsRequest is successfully created`.

```bash
$ kubectl get recommendation -n es elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez -o jsonpath='{.status}' | yq -y
approvalStatus: Approved
approvedWindow:
  window: Immediate
conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: '2025-02-27T11:54:50Z'
    message: OpsRequest is successfully created
    reason: SuccessfullyCreatedOperation
    status: 'True'
    type: SuccessfullyCreatedOperation
createdOperationRef:
  name: elastic-1740657290-rotate-tls-auto
failedAttempt: 0
outdated: false
parallelism: Namespace
phase: InProgress
reason: StartedExecutingOperation
```

You will find an `ElasticsearchOpsRequest` custom resource have been created and, it is rotating the authsecret of `elastic` cluster with negligible downtime. Let's wait for it to reach `Successful` status.

```bash
$ kubectl get elasticsearchopsrequest -n es elastic-1740657290-rotate-tls-auto -w
NAME                                 TYPE             STATUS        AGE
elastic-1740657290-rotate-tls-auto   ReconfigureTLS   Progressing   60s
elastic-1740657290-rotate-tls-auto   ReconfigureTLS   Progressing   114s
.
.
elastic-1740657290-rotate-tls-auto   ReconfigureTLS   Successful    12m

```

Let's recheck the recommendation for one last time. We should find that `.status.phase` has been marked as `Succeeded`.

```bash
$ kubectl get recommendation -n es elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez
NAME                                              STATUS      OUTDATED   AGE
elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez      Succeeded   false      78m
```

You may not want to do trigger recommended operations manually. Rather, trigger them autonomously in a preferred schedule when infrastructure is idle or traffic rate is at the lowest. For this purpose, You can create a `MaintenanceWindow` custom resource where you can set your desired schedule/period for triggering these recommended operations automatically. Here's a sample one:

```yaml
apiVersion: supervisor.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: MaintenanceWindow
metadata:
  name: elastic-maintenance
  namespace: es
spec:
  timezone: Asia/Dhaka
  days:
    Wednesday:
      - start: 5:40AM
        end: 7:00PM
  dates:
    - start: 2025-01-25T00:00:18Z
      end: 2025-01-25T23:41:18Z
```

You can now create a `ApprovalPolicy` custom resource to refer this `MaintenanceWindow` for particular DB type. Following is a sample `ApprovalPolicy` for any `Elasticsearch` custom resource deployed in `es` namespace. This `ApprovalPolicy` custom resource is referring to the `elastic-maintenance` MaintenanceWindow created in the same namespace. You can also create `ClusterMaintenanceWindow` instead which is effective for cluster-wide operations and refer it here. The following ApprovalPolicy will trigger recommended operations when referred maintenance window timeframe is reached.

```yaml
apiVersion: supervisor.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: ApprovalPolicy
metadata:
  name: es-policy
  namespace: es
maintenanceWindowRef:
  name: elastic-maintenance
targets:
  - group: kubedb.com
    kind: Elasticsearch
    operations:
      - group: ops.kubedb.com
        kind: ElasticsearchOpsRequest
```

Lastly, If you want to reject a recommendation, you can just set `ApprovalStatus` to `Rejected` in the recommendation status section. Here's how you can do it using kubectl cli.

```bash
$ kubectl patch Recommendation elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez \
                  -n es \
                  --type merge \
                  --subresource='status' \
                  -p '{"status":{"approvalStatus":"Rejected"}}'
recommendation.supervisor.appscode.com/elastic-x-elasticsearch-x-rotate-tls-6ujvez patched
```
