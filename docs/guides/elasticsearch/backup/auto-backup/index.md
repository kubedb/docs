# Backup Elasticsearch using Stash Auto-Backup

Stash can be configured to automatically backup any Elasticsearch database in your cluster. Stash enables cluster administrators to deploy backup blueprints ahead of time so that the database owners can easily backup their database with just a few annotations.

In this tutorial, we are going to show how you can configure a backup blueprint for Elasticsearch databases in your cluster and backup them with few annotations.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
- Install KubeDB in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).
- Install Stash Enterprise in your cluster following the steps [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/setup/install/enterprise/).
- If you are not familiar with how Stash backup and restore Elasticsearch databases, please check the following guide [here](/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/overview/index.md).
- If you are not familiar with how auto-backup works in Stash, please check the following guide [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/guides/auto-backup/overview/).
- If you are not familiar with the available auto-backup options for databases in Stash, please check the following guide [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/guides/auto-backup/database/).

You should be familiar with the following `Stash` concepts:

- [BackupBlueprint](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/backupblueprint/)
- [BackupConfiguration](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration/)
- [BackupSession](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/backupsession/)
- [Repository](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/repository/)
- [Function](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/function/)
- [Task](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/task/)

In this tutorial, we are going to show backup of three different Elasticsearch databases on three different namespaces named `demo`, `demo-2`, and `demo-3`. Create the namespaces as below if you haven't done it already.

```bash
❯ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created

❯ kubectl create ns demo-2
namespace/demo-2 created

❯ kubectl create ns demo-3
namespace/demo-3 created
```

When you install the Stash Enterprise edition, it automatically installs all the official database addons. Verify that it has installed the Elasticsearch addons using the following command.

```bash
❯ kubectl get tasks.stash.appscode.com | grep elasticsearch
elasticsearch-backup-5.6.4    4d4h
elasticsearch-backup-6.2.4    4d4h
elasticsearch-backup-6.3.0    4d4h
elasticsearch-backup-6.4.0    4d4h
elasticsearch-backup-6.5.3    4d4h
elasticsearch-backup-6.8.0    4d4h
elasticsearch-backup-7.2.0    4d4h
elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2    4d4h
elasticsearch-restore-5.6.4   4d4h
elasticsearch-restore-6.2.4   4d4h
elasticsearch-restore-6.3.0   4d4h
elasticsearch-restore-6.4.0   4d4h
elasticsearch-restore-6.5.3   4d4h
elasticsearch-restore-6.8.0   4d4h
elasticsearch-restore-7.2.0   4d4h
elasticsearch-restore-7.3.2   4d4h
```

## Prepare Backup Blueprint

To backup an Elasticsearch database using Stash, you have to create a `Secret` containing the backend credentials, a `Repository` containing the backend information, and a `BackupConfiguration` containing the schedule and target information. A `BackupBlueprint` allows you to specify a template for the `Repository` and the `BackupConfiguration`.

The `BackupBlueprint` is a non-namespaced CRD. So, once you have created a `BackupBlueprint`, you can use it to backup any Elasticsearch database of any namespace just by creating the storage `Secret` in that namespace and adding few annotations to your Elasticsearch CRO. Then, Stash will automatically create a `Repository` and a `BackupConfiguration` according to the template to backup the database.

Below is the `BackupBlueprint` object that we are going to use in this tutorial,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupBlueprint
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-backup-template
spec:
  # ============== Blueprint for Repository ==========================
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-testing
      prefix: stash-backup/${TARGET_NAMESPACE}/${TARGET_APP_RESOURCE}/${TARGET_NAME}
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
  # ============== Blueprint for BackupConfiguration =================
#  task: # Uncomment if you are not using KubeDB to deploy your database.
#    name: elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  interimVolumeTemplate:
    metadata:
      name: ${TARGET_APP_RESOURCE}-${TARGET_NAME} # To ensure that the PVC names are unique for different database
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "standard"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
  retentionPolicy:
    name: 'keep-last-5'
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

Here, we are using a GCS bucket as our backend. We are providing `gcs-secret` at the `storageSecretName` field. Hence, we have to create a secret named `gcs-secret` with the access credentials of our bucket in every namespace where we want to enable backup through this blueprint.

Notice the `prefix` field of `backend` section. We have used some variables in form of `${VARIABLE_NAME}`. Stash will automatically resolve those variables from the database information to make the backend prefix unique for each database instance.

We have also used some variables in `name` field of the `interimVolumeTemplate` section. This is to ensure that the generated PVC name becomes unique for the database instances.

Let's create the `BackupBlueprint` we have shown above,

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/auto-backup/examples/backupblueprint.yaml
backupblueprint.stash.appscode.com/elasticsearch-backup-template created
```

Now, we are ready to backup our Elasticsearch databases using few annotations. You can check available auto-backup annotations for a databases from [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/guides/auto-backup/database/#available-auto-backup-annotations-for-database).

## Auto-backup with default configurations

In this section, we are going to backup an Elasticsearch database of `demo` namespace. We are going to use the default configurations specified in the `BackupBlueprint`.

### Create Storage Secret

At first, let's create the `gcs-secret` in `demo` namespace with the access credentials to our GCS bucket.

```bash
❯ echo -n 'changeit' > RESTIC_PASSWORD
❯ echo -n '<your-project-id>' > GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
❯ cat downloaded-sa-key.json > GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
❯ kubectl create secret generic -n demo gcs-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
secret/gcs-secret created
```

### Create Database

Now, we are going to create an Elasticsearch CRO in `demo` namespace. Below is the YAML of the Elasticsearch object that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: es-demo
  namespace: demo
  annotations:
    stash.appscode.com/backup-blueprint: elasticsearch-backup-template
spec:
  version: xpack-8.11.1
  replicas: 1
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
    storageClassName: standard
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

Notice the `annotations` section. We are pointing to the `BackupBlueprint` that we have created earlier though `stash.appscode.com/backup-blueprint` annotation. Stash will watch this annotation and create a `Repository` and a `BackupConfiguration` according to the `BackupBlueprint`.

Let's create the above Elasticsearch CRO,

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/auto-backup/examples/es-demo.yaml
elasticsearch.kubedb.com/sample-elasticsearch created
```

### Verify Auto-backup configured

In this section, we are going to verify whether Stash has created the respective `Repository` and `BackupConfiguration` for our Elasticsearch database we have just deployed or not.

#### Verify Repository

At first, let's verify whether Stash has created a `Repository` for our Elasticsearch or not.

```bash
❯ kubectl get repository -n demo
NAME          INTEGRITY   SIZE   SNAPSHOT-COUNT   LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP   AGE
app-es-demo                                                                5s
```

Now, let's check the YAML of the `Repository`.

```yaml
❯ kubectl get repository -n demo app-es-demo -o yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
...
  name: app-es-demo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-testing
      prefix: stash-backup/demo/elasticsearch/es-demo
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
```

Here, you can see that Stash has resolved the variables in `prefix` field and substituted them with the equivalent information from this database.

#### Verify BackupConfiguration
If everything goes well, Stash should create a `BackupConfiguration` for our Elasticsearch in `demo` namespace and the phase of that `BackupConfiguration` should be `Ready`. Verify the `BackupConfiguration` crd by the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo
NAME          TASK                         SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
app-es-demo   elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2   */5 * * * *            Ready   12s
```

Now, let's check the YAML of the `BackupConfiguration`.

```yaml
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo app-es-demo -o yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: app-es-demo
  namespace: demo
  ...
spec:
  driver: Restic
  interimVolumeTemplate:
    metadata:
      name: elasticsearch-es-demo
    spec:
      accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
      storageClassName: standard
    status: {}
  repository:
    name: app-es-demo
  retentionPolicy:
    keepLast: 5
    name: keep-last-5
    prune: true
  runtimeSettings: {}
  schedule: '*/5 * * * *'
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: es-demo
  tempDir: {}
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T11:46:53Z"
    message: Repository demo/app-es-demo exist.
    reason: RepositoryAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: RepositoryFound
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T11:46:53Z"
    message: Backend Secret demo/gcs-secret exist.
    reason: BackendSecretAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: BackendSecretFound
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T11:46:53Z"
    message: Backup target appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1 appbinding/es-demo found.
    reason: TargetAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: BackupTargetFound
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T11:46:53Z"
    message: Successfully created backup triggering CronJob.
    reason: CronJobCreationSucceeded
    status: "True"
    type: CronJobCreated
  observedGeneration: 1
```

Notice the `interimVolumeTemplate` section. The variables of `name` field have been substituted by the equivalent information from the database.

Also, notice the `target` section. Stash has automatically added the Elasticsearch as the target of this `BackupConfiguration`.

#### Verify Backup

Now, let's wait for a backup run to complete. You can watch for `BackupSession` as below,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupsession -n demo -w
NAME                     INVOKER-TYPE          INVOKER-NAME   PHASE       AGE
app-es-demo-1613130605   BackupConfiguration   app-es-demo                0s
app-es-demo-1613130605   BackupConfiguration   app-es-demo    Running     10s
app-es-demo-1613130605   BackupConfiguration   app-es-demo    Succeeded   46s
```

Once the backup has been completed successfully, you should see the backed up data has been stored in the bucket at the directory pointed by the `prefix` field of the `Repository`.

<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Backup data in GCS Bucket" src="/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/auto-backup/images/es-demo.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Backup data in GCS Bucket</figcaption>
</figure>

## Auto-backup with a custom schedule

In this section, we are going to backup an Elasticsearch database of `demo-2` namespace. This time, we are going to overwrite the default schedule used in the `BackupBlueprint`.

### Create Storage Secret

At first, let's create the `gcs-secret` in `demo-2` namespace with the access credentials to our GCS bucket.

```bash
❯ kubectl create secret generic -n demo-2 gcs-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
secret/gcs-secret created
```

### Create Database

Now, we are going to create an Elasticsearch CRO in `demo-2` namespace. Below is the YAML of the Elasticsearch object that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: es-demo-2
  namespace: demo-2
  annotations:
    stash.appscode.com/backup-blueprint: elasticsearch-backup-template
    stash.appscode.com/schedule: "*/3 * * * *"
spec:
  version: xpack-8.11.1
  replicas: 1
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
    storageClassName: standard
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

Notice the `annotations` section. This time, we have passed a schedule via `stash.appscode.com/schedule` annotation along with the `stash.appscode.com/backup-blueprint` annotation.

Let's create the above Elasticsearch CRO,

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/auto-backup/examples/es-demo-2.yaml
elasticsearch.kubedb.com/es-demo-2 created
```

### Verify Auto-backup configured

Now, let's verify whether the auto-backup has been configured properly or not.

#### Verify Repository

At first, let's verify whether Stash has created a `Repository` for our Elasticsearch or not.

```bash
❯ kubectl get repository -n demo-2
NAME            INTEGRITY   SIZE   SNAPSHOT-COUNT   LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP   AGE
app-es-demo-2                                                                25s
```

Now, let's check the YAML of the `Repository`.

```yaml
❯ kubectl get repository -n demo-2 app-es-demo-2 -o yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: app-es-demo-2
  namespace: demo-2
  ...
spec:
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-testing
      prefix: stash-backup/demo-2/elasticsearch/es-demo-2
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
```

Here, you can see that Stash has resolved the variables in `prefix` field and substituted them with the equivalent information from this new database.

#### Verify BackupConfiguration

If everything goes well, Stash should create a `BackupConfiguration` for our Elasticsearch in `demo-2` namespace and the phase of that `BackupConfiguration` should be `Ready`. Verify the `BackupConfiguration` crd by the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo-2
NAME            TASK                         SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
app-es-demo-2   elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2   */3 * * * *            Ready   77s
```

Now, let's check the YAML of the `BackupConfiguration`.

```yaml
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo-2 app-es-demo-2 -o yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: app-es-demo-2
  namespace: demo-2
  ...
spec:
  driver: Restic
  interimVolumeTemplate:
    metadata:
      name: elasticsearch-es-demo-2
    spec:
      accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
      storageClassName: standard
    status: {}
  repository:
    name: app-es-demo-2
  retentionPolicy:
    keepLast: 5
    name: keep-last-5
    prune: true
  runtimeSettings: {}
  schedule: '*/3 * * * *'
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: es-demo-2
  tempDir: {}
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T12:24:07Z"
    message: Repository demo-2/app-es-demo-2 exist.
    reason: RepositoryAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: RepositoryFound
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T12:24:07Z"
    message: Backend Secret demo-2/gcs-secret exist.
    reason: BackendSecretAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: BackendSecretFound
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T12:24:07Z"
    message: Backup target appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1 appbinding/es-demo-2 found.
    reason: TargetAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: BackupTargetFound
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T12:24:07Z"
    message: Successfully created backup triggering CronJob.
    reason: CronJobCreationSucceeded
    status: "True"
    type: CronJobCreated
  observedGeneration: 1
```

Notice the `schedule` section. This time the `BackupConfiguration` has been created with the schedule we have provided via annotation.

Also, notice the `target` section. Stash has automatically added the new Elasticsearch as the target of this `BackupConfiguration`.

#### Verify Backup

Now, let's wait for a backup run to complete. You can watch for `BackupSession` as below,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupsession -n demo-2 -w
NAME                       INVOKER-TYPE          INVOKER-NAME    PHASE       AGE
app-es-demo-2-1613132831   BackupConfiguration   app-es-demo-2               0s
app-es-demo-2-1613132831   BackupConfiguration   app-es-demo-2   Running     17s
app-es-demo-2-1613132831   BackupConfiguration   app-es-demo-2   Succeeded   41s
```

Once the backup has been completed successfully, you should see that Stash has created a new directory as pointed by the `prefix` field of the new `Repository` and stored the backed up data there.

  <img alt="Backup data in GCS Bucket" src="/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/auto-backup/images/es-demo-2.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Backup data in GCS Bucket</figcaption>
</figure>

## Auto-backup with custom parameters

In this section, we are going to backup an Elasticsearch database of `demo-3` namespace. This time, we are going to pass some parameters for the Task through the annotations.

### Create Storage Secret

At first, let's create the `gcs-secret` in `demo-3` namespace with the access credentials to our GCS bucket.

```bash
❯ kubectl create secret generic -n demo-3 gcs-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
secret/gcs-secret created
```

### Create Database

Now, we are going to create an Elasticsearch CRO in `demo-3` namespace. Below is the YAML of the Elasticsearch object that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: es-demo-3
  namespace: demo-3
  annotations:
    stash.appscode.com/backup-blueprint: elasticsearch-backup-template
    params.stash.appscode.com/args: --ignoreType=settings,template
spec:
  version: xpack-8.11.1
  replicas: 1
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
    storageClassName: standard
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

Notice the `annotations` section. This time, we have passed an argument via `params.stash.appscode.com/args` annotation along with the `stash.appscode.com/backup-blueprint` annotation.

Let's create the above Elasticsearch CRO,

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/auto-backup/examples/es-demo-3.yaml
elasticsearch.kubedb.com/es-demo-3 created
```

### Verify Auto-backup configured

Now, let's verify whether the auto-backup resources has been created or not.

#### Verify Repository

At first, let's verify whether Stash has created a `Repository` for our Elasticsearch or not.

```bash
❯ kubectl get repository -n demo-3
NAME            INTEGRITY   SIZE   SNAPSHOT-COUNT   LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP   AGE
app-es-demo-3                                                                23s
```

Now, let's check the YAML of the `Repository`.

```yaml
❯ kubectl get repository -n demo-3 app-es-demo-3 -o yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: app-es-demo-3
  namespace: demo-3
  ...
spec:
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-testing
      prefix: stash-backup/demo-3/elasticsearch/es-demo-3
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
```

Here, you can see that Stash has resolved the variables in `prefix` field and substituted them with the equivalent information from this new database.

#### Verify BackupConfiguration

If everything goes well, Stash should create a `BackupConfiguration` for our Elasticsearch in `demo-3` namespace and the phase of that `BackupConfiguration` should be `Ready`. Verify the `BackupConfiguration` crd by the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo-3
NAME            TASK                         SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
app-es-demo-3   elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2   */5 * * * *            Ready   84s
```

Now, let's check the YAML of the `BackupConfiguration`.

```yaml
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo-3 app-es-demo-3 -o yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: app-es-demo-3
  namespace: demo-3
  ...
spec:
  driver: Restic
  interimVolumeTemplate:
    metadata:
      name: elasticsearch-es-demo-3
    spec:
      accessModes:

      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
      storageClassName: standard
    status: {}
  repository:
    name: app-es-demo-3
  retentionPolicy:
    keepLast: 5
    name: keep-last-5
    prune: true
  runtimeSettings: {}
  schedule: '*/5 * * * *'
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: es-demo-3
  task:
    params:
    - name: args
      value: --ignoreType=settings,template
  tempDir: {}
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T12:39:14Z"
    message: Repository demo-3/app-es-demo-3 exist.
    reason: RepositoryAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: RepositoryFound
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T12:39:14Z"
    message: Backend Secret demo-3/gcs-secret exist.
    reason: BackendSecretAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: BackendSecretFound
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-12T12:39:14Z"
    message: Backup target appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1 appbinding/es-demo-3 found.
    reason: TargetAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: BackupTargetFound

    message: Successfully created backup triggering CronJob.
    reason: CronJobCreationSucceeded
    status: "True"
    type: CronJobCreated
  observedGeneration: 1
```

Notice the `task` section. The `args` parameter that we had passed via annotations has been added to the `params` section.

Also, notice the `target` section. Stash has automatically added the new Elasticsearch as the target of this `BackupConfiguration`.

#### Verify Backup

Now, let's wait for a backup run to complete. You can watch for `BackupSession` as below,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupsession -n demo-3 -w
NAME                       INVOKER-TYPE          INVOKER-NAME    PHASE       AGE
app-es-demo-3-1613133604   BackupConfiguration   app-es-demo-3               0s
app-es-demo-3-1613133604   BackupConfiguration   app-es-demo-3   Running     5s
app-es-demo-3-1613133604   BackupConfiguration   app-es-demo-3   Succeeded   48s
```

Once the backup has been completed successfully, you should see that Stash has created a new directory as pointed by the `prefix` field of the new `Repository` and stored the backed up data there.
