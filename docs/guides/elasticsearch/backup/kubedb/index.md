# Backup and restore Elasticsearch database deployed with KubeDB

Stash 0.9.0+ supports backup and restoration of Elasticsearch clusters. This guide will show you how you can backup and restore your KubeDB deployed Elasticsearch database using Stash.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
- Install KubeDB in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).
- Install Stash Enterprise in your cluster following the steps [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/setup/install/enterprise/).
- Install Stash `kubectl` plugin following the steps [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/setup/install/kubectl-plugin/).
- If you are not familiar with how Stash backup and restore Elasticsearch databases, please check the following guide [here](/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/overview/index.md).

You have to be familiar with following custom resources:

- [AppBinding](/docs/guides/elasticsearch/concepts/appbinding/index.md)
- [Function](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/function/)
- [Task](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/task/)
- [BackupConfiguration](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration/)
- [BackupSession](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/backupsession/)
- [RestoreSession](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/restoresession/)

To keep things isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial. Create `demo` namespace if you haven't created it yet.

```console
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Prepare Elasticsearch

In this section, we are going to deploy an Elasticsearch database using KubeDB. Then, we are going to insert some sample data into it.

### Deploy Elasticsearch

At first, let's deploy a sample Elasticsearch database. Below is the YAML of a sample Elasticsearch crd that we are going to create for this tutorial:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: sample-es
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: xpack-8.11.1
  storageType: Durable
  topology:
    master:
      suffix: master
      replicas: 1
      storage:
        storageClassName: "standard"
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
    data:
      suffix: data
      replicas: 2
      storage:
        storageClassName: "standard"
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
    ingest:
      suffix: client
      replicas: 2
      storage:
        storageClassName: "standard"
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
```

Let's create the above `Elasticsearch` object,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/kubedb/examples/elasticsearch/sample_es.yaml
elasticsearch.kubedb.com/sample-es created
```

KubeDB will create the necessary resources to deploy the Elasticsearch database according to the above specification. Let's wait until the database to be ready to use,

```console
❯ kubectl get elasticsearch -n demo -w
NAME        VERSION          STATUS         AGE
sample-es   xpack-8.11.1   Provisioning   89s
sample-es   xpack-8.11.1   Ready          5m26s
```

The database is in `Ready` state. It means the database is ready to accept connections.

### Insert Sample Data

In this section, we are going to create few indexes in the deployed Elasticsearch. At first, we are going to port-forward the respective Service so that we can connect with the database from our local machine. Then, we are going to insert some data into the Elasticsearch.

#### Port-forward the Service

KubeDB will create few Services to connect with the database. Let's see the Services created by KubeDB for our Elasticsearch,

```bash
❯ kubectl get service -n demo
NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
sample-es          ClusterIP   10.108.129.195   <none>        9200/TCP   10m
sample-es-master   ClusterIP   None             <none>        9300/TCP   10m
sample-es-pods     ClusterIP   None             <none>        9200/TCP   10m
```

Here, we are going to use the `sample-es` Service to connect with the database. Now, let's port-forward the `sample-es` Service. Run the following command into a separate terminal.

```bash
❯ kubectl port-forward -n demo service/sample-es 9200
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9200 -> 9200
Forwarding from [::1]:9200 -> 9200
```

#### Export the Credentials

KubeDB will create some Secrets for the database. Let's check which Secrets have been created by KubeDB for our `sample-es` Elasticsearch.

```bash
❯ kubectl get secret -n demo | grep sample-es
sample-es-ca-cert          kubernetes.io/tls                     2      21m
sample-es-config           Opaque                                1      21m
sample-es-elastic-cred     kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      21m
sample-es-token-ctzn5      kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      21m
sample-es-transport-cert   kubernetes.io/tls                     3      21m
```

Here, `sample-es-elastic-cred` contains the credentials require to connect with the database. Let's export the credentials as environment variable to our current shell so that we can easily environment variables to connect with the database.

```bash
❯ export USER=$(kubectl get secrets -n demo sample-es-elastic-cred -o jsonpath='{.data.\username}' | base64 -d)
❯ export PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secrets -n demo sample-es-elastic-cred -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -d)
```

#### Insert data

Now, let's create an index called `products` and insert some data into it.

```bash
# Elasticsearch will automatically create the index if it does not exist already.
❯ curl -XPOST --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/products/_doc?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
    "name": "KubeDB",
    "vendor": "AppsCode Inc.",
    "description": "Database Operator for Kubernetes"
}
'

# Let's insert another data into the "products" index.
❯ curl -XPOST --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/products/_doc?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
    "name": "Stash",
    "vendor": "AppsCode Inc.",
    "description": "Backup tool for Kubernetes workloads"
}
'
```

Let's create another index called `companies` and insert some data into it.

```bash
❯ curl -XPOST --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/companies/_doc?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
    "name": "AppsCode Inc.",
    "mission": "Accelerate the transition to Containers by building a Kubernetes-native Data Platform",
    "products": ["KubeDB", "Stash", "KubeVault", "Kubeform", "ByteBuilders"]
}
'
```

Now, let's verify that the indexes have been created successfully.

```bash
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v&s=index&pretty"
health status index     uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   companies qs52L4xrShay14NPUExDNw   1   1          1            0     11.5kb          5.7kb
green  open   products  6aCd7y_kQf26sYG3QdY0ow   1   1          2            0     20.7kb         10.3kb
```

Also, let's verify the data in the indexes:

```bash
# Verify the data in the "product" index.
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/products/_search?pretty"
{
  "took" : 354,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "3GyXa3cB55U52E6TvL8f",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "KubeDB",
          "vendor" : "AppsCode Inc.",
          "description" : "Database Operator for Kubernetes"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "3WyYa3cB55U52E6Tc7_G",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Stash",
          "vendor" : "AppsCode Inc.",
          "description" : "Backup tool for Kubernetes workloads"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Verify data in the "companies" index.
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/companies/_search?pretty"
{
  "took" : 172,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "companies",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "3myya3cB55U52E6TE78a",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "AppsCode Inc.",
          "mission" : "Accelerate the transition to Containers by building a Kubernetes-native Data Platform",
          "products" : [
            "KubeDB",
            "Stash",
            "KubeVault",
            "Kubeform",
            "ByteBuilders"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We now have sample data in our database. In the next section, we are going to prepare the necessary resources to backup these sample data.

## Prepare for Backup

In this section, we are going to prepare our cluster for backup.

### Verify AppBinding

KubeDB will create an `AppBinding` object with the same name as the database object which contains the necessary information requires to connect with the database.

Let's verify that the `AppBinding` object has been created for our `sample-es` Elasticsearch,

```bash
❯ kubectl get appbindings.appcatalog.appscode.com -n demo sample-es
NAME        TYPE                       VERSION   AGE
sample-es   kubedb.com/elasticsearch   7.9.1     2d
```

Now, if you check the YAML of the `AppBinding`, you will see that it contains the service and secret information that are necessary to connect with the database.

```yaml
❯ kubectl get appbindings.appcatalog.appscode.com -n demo sample-es -o yaml
apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: AppBinding
metadata:
  name: sample-es
  namespace: demo
  ...
spec:
  clientConfig:
    service:
      name: sample-es
      port: 9200
      scheme: http
  secret:
    name: sample-es-elastic-cred
  parameters:
    apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
    kind: StashAddon
    stash:
      addon:
        backupTask:
          name: elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2
        restoreTask:
          name: elasticsearch-restore-7.3.2
  type: kubedb.com/elasticsearch
  version: 7.9.1
```

Here,

- `spec.parameters.stash` section specifies the Stash Addon that will be used to backup and restore this Elasticsearch.

### Verify Stash Elasticsearch Addons Installed

When you install the Stash Enterprise edition, it automatically installs all the official database addons. Verify that it has installed the Elasticsearch addons using the following command.

```bash
❯ kubectl get tasks.stash.appscode.com | grep elasticsearch
elasticsearch-backup-5.6.4    3d2h
elasticsearch-backup-6.2.4    3d2h
elasticsearch-backup-6.3.0    3d2h
elasticsearch-backup-6.4.0    3d2h
elasticsearch-backup-6.5.3    3d2h
elasticsearch-backup-6.8.0    3d2h
elasticsearch-backup-7.2.0    3d2h
elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2    3d2h
elasticsearch-restore-5.6.4   3d2h
elasticsearch-restore-6.2.4   3d2h
elasticsearch-restore-6.3.0   3d2h
elasticsearch-restore-6.4.0   3d2h
elasticsearch-restore-6.5.3   3d2h
elasticsearch-restore-6.8.0   3d2h
elasticsearch-restore-7.2.0   3d2h
elasticsearch-restore-7.3.2   3d2h
```

### Prepare Backend

We are going to store our backed up data into a GCS bucket. So, we need to create a `Secret` with GCS credentials and a `Repository` object with the bucket information. If you want to use a different backend, please read the respective backend configuration doc from [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/guides/backends/overview/).

#### Create Storage Secret

At first, let's create a `Secret` called `gcs-secret` with access credentials to our desired GCS bucket,

```bash
$ echo -n 'changeit' > RESTIC_PASSWORD
$ echo -n '<your-project-id>' > GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
$ cat downloaded-sa-key.json > GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
$ kubectl create secret generic -n demo gcs-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
secret/gcs-secret created
```

#### Create Repository

Now, crete a `Repository` object with the information of your desired bucket. Below is the YAML of `Repository` object we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: gcs-repo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-testing
      prefix: /demo/sample-es
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
```

Let's create the `Repository` we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/kubedb/examples/backup/repository.yaml
repository.stash.appscode.com/gcs-repo created
```

Now, we are ready to back up our database into our desired backend.

## Backup

To schedule a backup, we have to create a `BackupConfiguration` object targeting the respective `AppBinding` of our desired database. Then, Stash will create a CronJob to periodically trigger a backup of the database.

### Create BackupConfiguration

Below is the YAML for `BackupConfiguration` object we care going to use to backup the `sample-es` database we have deployed earlier,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: sample-es-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  repository:
    name: gcs-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: sample-es
  interimVolumeTemplate:
    metadata:
      name: sample-es-backup-tmp-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "standard"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
  retentionPolicy:
    name: keep-last-5
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

Here,

- `.spec.schedule` specifies that we want to backup the database every 5th minutes.
- `.spec.target.ref` refers to the `AppBinding` object that holds the connection information of our targeted database.
- `spec.interimVolumeTemplate` specifies a PVC template that will be used by Stash to hold the dumped data temporarily before uploading it into the cloud bucket.

Let's create the `BackupConfiguration` object we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/kubedb/examples/backup/backupconfiguration.yaml
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-es-backup created
```

### Verify Backup Setup Successful

If everything goes well, the phase of the `BackupConfiguration` should be `Ready`. The `Ready` phase indicates that the backup setup is successful. Let's verify the `Phase` of the BackupConfiguration,

```bash
$ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo
NAME               TASK                         SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE      AGE
sample-es-backup   elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2   */5 * * * *            Ready      11s
```

### Verify CronJob

Stash will create a CronJob with the schedule specified in the `spec.schedule` field of `BackupConfiguration` object.

Verify that the CronJob has been created using the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                            SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-es-backup   */5 * * * *   False     0        <none>          9s
```

### Wait for BackupSession

The `stash-backup-sample-es-backup` CronJob will trigger a backup on each scheduled slot by creating a `BackupSession` object.

Now, wait for a schedule to appear. Run the following command to watch for a `BackupSession` object,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupsessions.stash.appscode.com -n demo -w
NAME                          INVOKER-TYPE          INVOKER-NAME       PHASE       AGE
sample-es-backup-1612440003   BackupConfiguration   sample-es-backup               0s
sample-es-backup-1612440003   BackupConfiguration   sample-es-backup   Running     0s
sample-es-backup-1612440003   BackupConfiguration   sample-es-backup   Succeeded   54s
```

Here, the phase `Succeeded` means that the backup process has been completed successfully.

### Verify Backup

Now, we are going to verify whether the backed up data is present in the backend or not. Once a backup is completed, Stash will update the respective `Repository` object to reflect the backup completion. Check that the repository `gcs-repo` has been updated by the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get repository -n demo gcs-repo
NAME       INTEGRITY   SIZE        SNAPSHOT-COUNT   LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP   AGE
gcs-repo   true        3.801 KiB   1                64s                      3m46s
```

Now, if we navigate to the GCS bucket, we will see the backed up data has been stored in `demo/sample-es` directory as specified by the `.spec.backend.gcs.prefix` field of the `Repository` object.

<figure align="center">
  <img alt="Backup data in GCS Bucket" src="/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/kubedb/images/sample-es-backup.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Backup data in GCS Bucket</figcaption>
</figure>

> Note: Stash keeps all the backed up data encrypted. So, data in the backend will not make any sense until they are decrypted.

## Restore

If you have followed the previous sections properly, you should have a successful backup of your Elasticsearch database. Now, we are going to show how you can restore the database from the backed up data.

### Restore into the same Elasticsearch

You can restore your data into the same database you have backed up from or into a different database in the same cluster or a different cluster. In this section, we are going to show you how to restore in the same database which may be necessary when you have accidentally deleted any data from the running database.

#### Temporarily pause backup

At first, let's stop taking any further backup of the database so that no backup runs after we delete the sample data. We are going to pause the `BackupConfiguration` object. Stash will stop taking any further backup when the `BackupConfiguration` is paused.

Let's pause the `sample-es-backup` BackupConfiguration,

```bash
❯ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n demo sample-es-backup --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": true}}'
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-es-backup patched
```
Or you can use the Stash `kubectl` plugin to pause the `BackupConfiguration`, 
```bash
❯ kubectl stash pause backup -n demo --backupconfig=sample-es-backup
BackupConfiguration demo/sample-es-backup has been paused successfully.
```

Verify that the `BackupConfiguration` has been paused,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo sample-es-backup
NAME               TASK                         SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
sample-es-backup   elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2   */5 * * * *   true     Ready   12m
```

Notice the `PAUSED` column. Value `true` for this field means that the `BackupConfiguration` has been paused.

Stash will also suspend the respective CronJob.

```bash
❯ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                            SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-es-backup   */5 * * * *   True      0        5m19s           12m
```

#### Simulate Disaster

Now, let's simulate an accidental deletion scenario. Here, we are going to delete the `products` and `companies` indexes that we had created earlier.

```bash
# Delete "products" index
❯ curl -XDELETE --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/products?pretty"
{
  "acknowledged" : true
}

# Delete "companies" index
❯ curl -XDELETE --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/companies?pretty"
{
  "acknowledged" : true
}
```

Now, let's verify that the indexes have been deleted from the database,

```bash
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v&s=index&pretty"
health status index uuid pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
```

So, we can see our `sample-es` database does not have any indexes. In the next section, we are going to restore the deleted indexes from backed up data.

#### Create RestoreSession

To restore the database, you have to create a `RestoreSession` object pointing to the `AppBinding` of the targeted database.

Here, is the YAML of the `RestoreSession` object that we are going to use for restoring our `sample-es` database.

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: RestoreSession
metadata:
  name: sample-es-restore
  namespace: demo
spec:
  repository:
    name: gcs-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: sample-es
  interimVolumeTemplate:
    metadata:
      name: sample-es-restore-tmp-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "standard"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
  rules:
  - snapshots: [latest]
```

Here,

- `.spec.repository.name` specifies the `Repository` object that holds the backend information where our backed up data has been stored.
- `.spec.target.ref` refers to the respective `AppBinding` of the `sample-es` database.
- `spec.interimVolumeTemplate` specifies a PVC template that will be used by Stash to hold the restored data temporarily before injecting it into the database.
- `.spec.rules` specifies that we are restoring data from the latest backup snapshot of the database.

Let's create the `RestoreSession` object object we have shown above,

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/kubedb/examples/restore/restoresession.yaml
restoresession.stash.appscode.com/sample-es-restore created
```

Once, you have created the `RestoreSession` object, Stash will create a restore Job. Run the following command to watch the phase of the `RestoreSession` object,

```bash
❯ kubectl get restoresession -n demo -w
NAME                REPOSITORY   PHASE       AGE
sample-es-restore   gcs-repo     Running     8s
sample-es-restore   gcs-repo     Running     24s
sample-es-restore   gcs-repo     Succeeded   24s
sample-es-restore   gcs-repo     Succeeded   25s
```

The `Succeeded` phase means that the restore process has been completed successfully.

#### Verify Restored Data

Now, it's time to verify whether the actual data has been restored or not. At first, let's verify that whether the indexes have been restored or not:

```bash
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v&s=index&pretty"
health status index     uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   companies 7UgxlL4wST6ZIAImxRVvzw   1   1          1            0     11.4kb          5.7kb
green  open   products  vb19PIneSL2zMTPvNEgm-w   1   1          2            0     10.8kb          5.4kb
```

So, we can see the indexes have been restored. Now, let's verify the data of these indexes,

```bash
# Verify the data of the "products" index
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/products/_search?pretty"
{
  "took" : 3,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "vKDVgXcBa1PZYKwIDBjy",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Stash",
          "vendor" : "AppsCode Inc.",
          "description" : "Backup tool for Kubernetes workloads"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "u6DUgXcBa1PZYKwI5xic",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "KubeDB",
          "vendor" : "AppsCode Inc.",
          "description" : "Database Operator for Kubernetes"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Verify the data of "companies" index
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/companies/_search?pretty"
{
  "took" : 2,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "companies",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "vaDVgXcBa1PZYKwIMxhm",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "AppsCode Inc.",
          "mission" : "Accelerate the transition to Containers by building a Kubernetes-native Data Platform",
          "products" : [
            "KubeDB",
            "Stash",
            "KubeVault",
            "Kubeform",
            "ByteBuilders"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

So, we can see that the data has been restored as well.

#### Resume Backup

Since our data has been restored successfully we can now resume our usual backup process. Resume the `BackupConfiguration` using following command,
```bash
❯ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n demo sample-es-backup --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": false}}'
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-es-backup patched
```

Or you can use Stash `kubectl` plugin to resume the `BackupConfiguration`, 
```bash
❯ kubectl stash resume -n demo --backupconfig=sample-es-backup
BackupConfiguration demo/sample-es-backup has been resumed successfully.
```

Verify that the `BackupConfiguration` has been resumed,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo sample-es-backup
NAME               TASK                         SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
sample-es-backup   elasticsearch-backup-7.3.2   */5 * * * *   false    Ready   30m
```

Here,  `false` in the `PAUSED` column means the backup has been resume successfully. The CronJob also should be resumed now.

```bash
❯ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                            SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-es-backup   */5 * * * *   False     0        2m50s           30m
```

Here, `False` in the `SUSPEND` column means the CronJob is no longer suspended and will trigger in the next schedule.

### Restore into a different Elasticsearch

Now, we are going to restore the backed up data into a different Elasticsearch of a different namespace. This time, we are going to use `opendistro` variant for Elasticsearch to demonstrate migration between the variants. You can use the same variant of Elasticsearch if you are not considering to migrate from your current variant.

We are going to restore the data into an Elasticsearch in `restored` namespace. If you already don't have the namespace, let's create it first.

```bash
❯ kubectl create ns restored
namespace/restored created
```

#### Copy Repository and backend Secret into the new namespace

Now, let's copy the `gcs-repo` Repository into our new namespace using the `stash` kubectl plugin,

```bash
❯ kubectl stash cp repository gcs-repo -n demo --to-namespace=restored
I0208 19:51:43.950560  666626 copy_repository.go:58] Repository demo/gcs-repo uses Storage Secret demo/gcs-secret.
I0208 19:51:43.952899  666626 copy_secret.go:60] Copying Storage Secret demo to restored namespace
I0208 19:51:43.957204  666626 copy_secret.go:73] Secret demo/gcs-secret has been copied to restored namespace successfully.
I0208 19:51:43.967768  666626 copy_repository.go:75] Repository demo/gcs-repo has been copied to restored namespace successfully.
```

The above command will copy the `gcs-repo` Repository as well as the respective backend secret `gcs-secret`.

Let's verify that the `Repository` has been copied into `restored` namespace,

```bash
❯ kubectl get repository -n restored
NAME       INTEGRITY   SIZE   SNAPSHOT-COUNT   LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP   AGE
gcs-repo                                                                2m9s
```

>The command does not copy the status of the `Repository`. As a result, you will see the `INTEGRITY`, `SIZE`, `SNAPSHOT-COUNT`, and `LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP` fields are empty. Nothing to panic about here. Your actual data exist safely in the cloud bucket. The `Repository` just contains the connection information to that bucket.

Now, let's verify that the backend secret has been copied as well,

```bash
❯ kubectl get secret -n restored
NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-token-rd2v5   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      15m
gcs-secret            Opaque                                3      8m36s
```

As you can see, the backend secret `gcs-secret` also has been copied to `restored` namespace.

#### Deploy new Elasticsearch

Now, we are going to deploy an Elasticsearch into `restored` namespace. We are going to initialize this database from the backed up data of first Elasticsearch.

Here, is the YAML of the Elasticsearch object that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: init-sample
  namespace: restored
spec:
  version: opensearch-2.8.0
  storageType: Durable
  init:
    waitForInitialRestore: true
  topology:
    master:
      suffix: master
      replicas: 1
      storage:
        storageClassName: "standard"
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
    data:
      suffix: data
      replicas: 2
      storage:
        storageClassName: "standard"
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
    ingest:
      suffix: client
      replicas: 2
      storage:
        storageClassName: "standard"
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
```

Notice that this time, we are using `1.9.0-opendistro` variant for Elasticsearch. Also, notice that we have added an `init` section in the `spec`. Here, `waitForInitialRestore: true` tells KubeDB to wait for the first restore to complete before marking this database as ready to use.

Let's deploy the above Elasticsearch,

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/kubedb/examples/elasticsearch/init_sample.yaml
elasticsearch.kubedb.com/init-sample created
```

Now, wait for the KubeDB to create all the nodes for this Elasticsearch. This time, Elasticsearch will get stuck in the `Provisioning` state because we haven't completed the first restore yet.

You can check the condition of the Elasticsearch to verify whether we are ready to restore the database.

```bash
❯ kubectl get elasticsearch -n restored init-sample -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}' | jq
[
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2021-02-08T14:13:22Z",
    "message": "The KubeDB operator has started the provisioning of Elasticsearch: restored/init-sample",
    "reason": "DatabaseProvisioningStartedSuccessfully",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "ProvisioningStarted"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2021-02-08T14:18:15Z",
    "message": "All desired replicas are ready.",
    "reason": "AllReplicasReady",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "ReplicaReady"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2021-02-08T14:19:22Z",
    "message": "The Elasticsearch: restored/init-sample is accepting client requests.",
    "observedGeneration": 3,
    "reason": "DatabaseAcceptingConnectionRequest",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "AcceptingConnection"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2021-02-08T14:19:33Z",
    "message": "The Elasticsearch: restored/init-sample is ready.",
    "observedGeneration": 3,
    "reason": "ReadinessCheckSucceeded",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "Ready"
  }
]
```

Here, check the last two conditions. We can see that the database has passed the readiness check from `Ready` conditions and it is accepting connections from `AcceptingConnection` condition. So, we are good to start restoring into this database.

KubeDB has created an AppBinding for this database. Let's verify that the AppBinding has been created,

```bash
❯ kubectl get appbindings.appcatalog.appscode.com -n restored
NAME          TYPE                       VERSION   AGE
init-sample   kubedb.com/elasticsearch   7.8.0     21m
```

We are going to create a `RestoreSession` targeting this AppBinding to restore into this database.

#### Create RestoreSession for new Elasticsearch

Now, we have to create a `RestoreSession` object targeting the `AppBinding` of our `init-sample` database. Here, is the YAML of the RestoreSession that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: RestoreSession
metadata:
  name: init-sample-restore
  namespace: restored
spec:
  repository:
    name: gcs-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: init-sample
  interimVolumeTemplate:
    metadata:
      name: init-sample-restore-tmp-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "standard"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
  rules:
  - snapshots: [latest]
```

Let's create the above RestoreSession,

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/elasticsearch/backup/kubedb/examples/restore/init_sample_restore.yaml
restoresession.stash.appscode.com/init-sample-restore created
```

Now, wait for the restore process to complete,

```bash
❯ kubectl get restoresession -n restored -w
NAME                  REPOSITORY   PHASE     AGE
init-sample-restore   gcs-repo     Running   4s
init-sample-restore   gcs-repo     Running   21s
init-sample-restore   gcs-repo     Succeeded   21s
init-sample-restore   gcs-repo     Succeeded   21s
```

#### Verify Restored Data in new Elasticsearch

Now, we are going to verify whether the data has been restored or not. At first let's port-forward the respective Service for this Elasticsearch,

```bash
❯ kubectl get service -n restored
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
init-sample          ClusterIP   10.109.51.219   <none>        9200/TCP   54m
init-sample-master   ClusterIP   None            <none>        9300/TCP   54m
init-sample-pods     ClusterIP   None            <none>        9200/TCP   54m
```

```bash
❯ kubectl port-forward -n restored service/init-sample 9200
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9200 -> 9200
Forwarding from [::1]:9200 -> 9200
```

Now, let's export the credentials of this Elasticsearch,

```bash
❯ kubectl get secret -n restored | grep init-sample
init-sample-admin-cred                            kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      55m
init-sample-ca-cert                               kubernetes.io/tls                     2      55m
init-sample-config                                Opaque                                3      55m
init-sample-kibanaro-cred                         kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      55m
init-sample-kibanaserver-cred                     kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      55m
init-sample-logstash-cred                         kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      55m
init-sample-readall-cred                          kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      55m
init-sample-snapshotrestore-cred                  kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      55m
init-sample-token-xgnrx                           kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      55m
init-sample-transport-cert                        kubernetes.io/tls                     3      55m
stash-restore-init-sample-restore-0-token-vscdt   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      4m40s
```

Here, we are going to use the `init-sample-admin-cred` for connecting with the database. Let's export the `username` and `password` keys.

```bash
❯ export USER=$(kubectl get secrets -n restored init-sample-admin-cred -o jsonpath='{.data.\username}' | base64 -d)
❯ export PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secrets -n restored init-sample-admin-cred -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -d)
```

Now, let's verify whether the indexes have been restored or not.

```bash
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v&s=index&pretty"
health status index                uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   .opendistro_security _v-_YiJUReylNbUaIEXN8A   1   1          7            0     57.1kb         37.1kb
green  open   companies            XfSvxePuS7-lNq-gcd-bxg   1   1          1            0     11.1kb          5.5kb
green  open   products             pZYHzOp_TWK9bLaEU-uj8Q   1   1          2            0     10.5kb          5.2kb
```

So, we can see that our indexes have been restored successfully. Now, let's verify the data of these indexes.

```bash
# Verify data of "products" index
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/products/_search?pretty"
{
  "took" : 634,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "u6DUgXcBa1PZYKwI5xic",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "KubeDB",
          "vendor" : "AppsCode Inc.",
          "description" : "Database Operator for Kubernetes"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "vKDVgXcBa1PZYKwIDBjy",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Stash",
          "vendor" : "AppsCode Inc.",
          "description" : "Backup tool for Kubernetes workloads"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Verify data of "companies" index
❯ curl -XGET --user "$USER:$PASSWORD" "http://localhost:9200/companies/_search?pretty"
{
  "took" : 5,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "companies",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "vaDVgXcBa1PZYKwIMxhm",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "AppsCode Inc.",
          "mission" : "Accelerate the transition to Containers by building a Kubernetes-native Data Platform",
          "products" : [
            "KubeDB",
            "Stash",
            "KubeVault",
            "Kubeform",
            "ByteBuilders"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

So, we can see that the data of these indexes data has been restored too.

### Restore into a different cluster

If you want to restore into a different cluster, you have to install KubeDB and Stash in the desired cluster. Then, you have to install Stash Elasticsearch addon in that cluster too. Then, you have to deploy the target database there. Once, the database is ready to accept connections, create the Repository, backend Secret, in the same namespace as the database of your desired cluster. Finally, create the `RestoreSession` object in the desired cluster pointing to the AppBinding of the targeted database of that cluster.

## Cleanup

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```bash
# delete all reasources from "demo" namespace
kubectl delete -n demo backupconfiguration sample-es-backup
kubectl delete -n demo restoresession sample-es-restore
kubectl delete -n demo repository gcs-repo
kubectl delete -n demo secret gcs-repo
kubectl delete -n demo secret gcs-secret
kubectl delete -n demo elasticsearch  sample-es

# delete all reasources from "restored" namespace
kubectl delete -n restored restoresession init-sample-restore
kubectl delete -n restored repository gcs-repo
kubectl delete -n restored secret gcs-secret
kubectl delete -n restored elasticsearch  init-sample
```
