# Visualize PgBouncer Using Grafana Dashboard

[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) is an open source, feature rich metrics dashboard and graph editor for Graphite, Elasticsearch, OpenTSDB, Prometheus and InfluxDB. PgBouncer comes with a Grafana dashboard designed to monitor real-time updates of PgBouncer servers using Prometheus metrics.

This tutorial will show you how to import our dashboard on Grafana to monitor PgBouncer deployed with KubeDB.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- To learn how Prometheus monitoring works with KubeDB in general, please visit [here](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/monitoring/overview.md).

- You need to have monitoring enabled using either [Builtin Prometheus](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/monitoring/using-builtin-prometheus.md) or [Prometheus operator](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/monitoring/using-builtin-prometheus.md).

- To keep everything isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `monitoring` to deploy respective monitoring resources. We are going to deploy database in `demo` namespace.

  ```bash
  $ kubectl create ns monitoring
  namespace/monitoring created

  $ kubectl create ns demo
  namespace/demo created
  ```

> Note: YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/examples/pgbouncer](https://github.com/kubedb/docs/tree/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/pgbouncer) folder in GitHub repository [kubedb/docs](https://github.com/kubedb/docs).

## Deploy Grafana

After you have made sure that you have a PgBouncer server running with Monitoring enabled, you're ready to deploy your very own Grafana server. If you still have not deployed PgBouncer server with monitoring enabled, then do so using [Builtin Prometheus](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/monitoring/using-builtin-prometheus.md) or [Prometheus operator](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/monitoring/using-builtin-prometheus.md).

However, if you already have a Grafana server running in your cluster, feel free to skip this part. Otherwise, create one using:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/pgbouncer/monitoring/grafana.yaml
deployment.apps/grafana created
```

Let's get the name of the pod created by this deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n monitoring -l "app=grafana"

NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
grafana-7cbd6b6f87-w9dkh   1/1     Running   0          57s
```

## View Dashboard

Now, we have to expose the Grafana pod so that we can access it from a browser.

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward -n monitoring grafana-7cbd6b6f87-w9dkh 3000
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3000 -> 3000
Forwarding from [::1]:3000 -> 3000
```

Grafana should now be available on [localhost](http://localhost:3000/). Use default credentials `(username: admin, password: admin)` to login to Grafana Dashboard.

## Add Data Source

First, we need to know the name of the service that exposes our prometheus server pods. In  this tutorial, we have used a service named `prometheus-operated` that exposes our prometheus metrics on port 9090.

```bash
$ kubectl get service -n monitoring
NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
prometheus-operated   ClusterIP   10.111.246.229   <none>        9090/TCP   38m
```

We will use this service to point Grafana to our desired data source.

From Home Dashboard, go to [Configuration > Data Sources](http://localhost:3000/datasources), and select `Add data source`. Select `Prometheus` as the `data source type`.

In the following screen, add `http://prometheus-operated.monitoring.svc:9090` as the data source `URL`,  give it a name `PGBOUNCER_PROMETHEUS`, and press the `Save and Test` button.  You should get a message confirming that the `Data source is working`.

## Import Dashboard

Now, go to [http://localhost:3000/dashboard/import](http://localhost:3000/dashboard/import) to import our PgBouncer Dashboard. Put `10945` as the grafana dashboard id. Select `PGBOUNCER_PROMETHEUS` as the data source, and press `import`. You will now be directed to your PgBouncer dashboard.

## Cleaning up

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run the following commands

```bash
# cleanup prometheus resources
kubectl delete -n monitoring deployment grafana

# delete namespace
kubectl delete ns monitoring
```

## Next Steps

- Monitor your PgBouncer with KubeDB using [built-in Prometheus](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/monitoring/using-builtin-prometheus.md).
- Monitor your PgBouncer with KubeDB using [Prometheus operator](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/monitoring/using-prometheus-operator.md).
