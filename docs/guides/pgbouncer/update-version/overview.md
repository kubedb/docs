# updating PgBouncer version Overview

This guide will give you an overview on how KubeDB Ops-manager operator update the version of `PgBouncer`.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [PgBouncer](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/concepts/pgbouncer.md)
  - [PgBouncerOpsRequest](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/concepts/opsrequest.md)

## How update version Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB Ops-manager operator used to update the version of `PgBouncer`. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The updating process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `PgBouncer` Custom Resource (CR).

2. `KubeDB` Provisioner  operator watches the `PgBouncer` CR.

3. When the operator finds a `PgBouncer` CR, it creates required number of `PetSets` and related necessary stuff like secrets, services, etc.

4. Then, in order to update the version of the `PgBouncer` the user creates a `PgBouncerOpsRequest` CR with the desired version.

5. `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator watches the `PgBouncerOpsRequest` CR.

6. When it finds a `PgBouncerOpsRequest` CR, it halts the `PgBouncer` object which is referred from the `PgBouncerOpsRequest`. So, the `KubeDB` Provisioner  operator doesn't perform any operations on the `PgBouncer` object during the updating process.  

7. By looking at the target version from `PgBouncerOpsRequest` CR, `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator updates the image of the `PetSet`.

8. After successfully updating the `PetSet` and their `Pods` images, the `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator updates the image of the `PgBouncer` object to reflect the updated state of the database.

9. After successfully updating of `PgBouncer` object, the `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator resumes the `PgBouncer` object so that the `KubeDB` Provisioner  operator can resume its usual operations.

In the next doc, we are going to show a step-by-step guide on updating of a PgBouncer using updateVersion operation.
