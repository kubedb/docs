# Running PgBouncer

This tutorial will show you how to use KubeDB to run a PgBouncer.

<p align="center">

</p>

## Before You Begin

At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).

To keep things isolated, this tutorial uses a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

> Note: YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/examples/pgbouncer](https://github.com/kubedb/docs/tree/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/pgbouncer) folder in GitHub repository [kubedb/docs](https://github.com/kubedb/docs).

> We have designed this tutorial to demonstrate a production setup of KubeDB managed PgBouncer. If you just want to try out KubeDB, you can bypass some of the safety features following the tips [here](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/quickstart/quickstart.md#tips-for-testing).

## Find Available PgBouncerVersion

When you have installed KubeDB, it has created `PgBouncerVersion` crd for all supported PgBouncer versions. Let's check available PgBouncerVersion by,

```bash
$ kubectl get pgbouncerversions

  NAME     VERSION   PGBOUNCER_IMAGE           DEPRECATED   AGE
  1.17.0   1.17.0    kubedb/pgbouncer:1.17.0                2d23h
```

Notice the `DEPRECATED` column. Here, `true` means that this PgBouncerVersion is deprecated for current KubeDB version. KubeDB will not work for deprecated PgBouncerVersion.

In this tutorial, we will use `1.17.0` PgBouncerVersion crd to create PgBouncer. To know more about what `PgBouncerVersion` crd is, please visit [here](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/concepts/catalog.md). You can also see supported PgBouncerVersion [here](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/README.md#supported-pgbouncerversion-crd).

## Get PostgreSQL Server ready

PgBouncer is a connection-pooling middleware for PostgreSQL. Therefore you will need to have a PostgreSQL server up and running for PgBouncer to connect to.

Luckily PostgreSQL is readily available in KubeDB as crd and can easily be deployed using this guide [here](/docs/guides/postgres/quickstart/quickstart.md).

In this tutorial, we will use a Postgres named `quick-postgres` in the `demo` namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/pgbouncer/quickstart/quick-postgres.yaml
postgres.kubedb.com/quick-postgres created
```

KubeDB creates all the necessary resources including services, secrets, and appbindings to get this server up and running. A default database `postgres` is created in `quick-postgres`. Database secret `quick-postgres-auth` holds this user's username and password. Following is the yaml file for it.

```yaml
$ kubectl get secrets -n demo quick-postgres-auth -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: WkZvcGVMbndrU2ZfZjVZcw==
  username: cG9zdGdyZXM=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-06-01T11:51:32Z"
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: database
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: quick-postgres
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubedb.com
    app.kubernetes.io/name: postgreses.kubedb.com
  name: quick-postgres-auth
  namespace: demo
  resourceVersion: "195262"
  uid: abe166bc-a1da-40d9-8a5e-996a8f5d6246
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth

```

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will need to extract the username and password from database secret `quick-postgres-auth`.

```bash
$ kubectl get secrets -n demo quick-postgres-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -d
ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys⏎ 

$ kubectl get secrets -n demo quick-postgres-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\username}' | base64 -d
postgres⏎ 
```

Now, to test connection with this database using the credentials obtained above, we will expose the service port associated with `quick-postgres`  to localhost.

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward -n demo svc/quick-postgres 5432
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:5432 -> 5432
Forwarding from [::1]:5432 -> 5432
```

With that done , we should now be able to connect to `postgres` database using username `postgres`, and password `ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys`.

```bash
$ export PGPASSWORD=ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys
$ psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres postgres
psql (14.1 (Ubuntu 14.1-2.pgdg20.04+1), server 13.2)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
```

After establishing connection successfully, we will create a table in `postgres` database and populate it with data.

```bash
postgres=# CREATE TABLE COMPANY( NAME TEXT NOT NULL, EMPLOYEE INT NOT NULL);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO COMPANY (name, employee) VALUES ('Apple',10);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# INSERT INTO COMPANY (name, employee) VALUES ('Google',15);
INSERT 0 1
```

After data insertion, we need to verify that our data have been inserted successfully.

```bash
postgres=# SELECT * FROM company ORDER BY name;
  name  | employee
--------+----------
 Apple  |       10
 Google |       15
(2 rows)
postgres=# \q
```

If no error occurs, `quick-postgres` is ready to be used by PgBouncer.

You can also use any other tool to deploy your PostgreSQL server and create a database `postgres` for user `postgres`.

Should you choose not to use KubeDB to deploy Postgres, create AppBinding(s) to point PgBouncer to your PostgreSQL server(s) where your target databases are located. Click [here](/docs/guides/pgbouncer/concepts/appbinding.md) for detailed instructions on how to manually create AppBindings for Postgres.

## Create a PgBouncer Server

KubeDB implements a PgBouncer crd to define the specifications of a PgBouncer.

Below is the PgBouncer object created in this tutorial.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: PgBouncer
metadata:
  name: pgbouncer-server
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "1.17.0"
  replicas: 1
  databases:
  - alias: "postgres"
    databaseName: "postgres"
    databaseRef:
      name: "quick-postgres"
      namespace: demo
  connectionPool:
    maxClientConnections: 20
    reservePoolSize: 5
    adminUsers:
    - admin
    - admin1
  userListSecretRef:
    name: db-user-pass
  terminationPolicy: Delete
```

Here,

- `spec.version` is name of the PgBouncerVersion crd where the docker images are specified. In this tutorial, a PgBouncer with base image version 1.17.0 is created.
- `spec.replicas` specifies the number of replica pgbouncer server pods to be created for the PgBouncer object.
- `spec.databases` specifies the databases that are going to be served via PgBouncer.
- `spec.connectionPool` specifies the configurations for connection pool.
- `spec.userListSecretRef` specifies the secret that contains the standard pgbouncer `userlist` file.
- `spec.terminationPolicy` specifies what policy to apply while deletion.

### spec.databases

Databases contain three `required` fields and two `optional` fields.

- `spec.databases.alias`:  specifies an alias for the target database located in a postgres server specified by an appbinding.
- `spec.databases.databaseName`:  specifies the name of the target database.
- `spec.databases.databaseRef`:  specifies the name and namespace of the appBinding that contains the path to a PostgreSQL server where the target database can be found.
- `spec.databases.username` (optional):  specifies the user with whom this particular database should have an exclusive connection. By default, if this field is left empty, all users will be able to use the database.
- `spec.databases.password` (optional):  specifies password to authenticate the user with whom this particular database should have an exclusive connection.

### spec.connectionPool

ConnectionPool is used to configure pgbouncer connection pool. All the fields here are accompanied by default values and can be left unspecified if no customization is required by the user.

- `spec.connectionPool.port`: specifies the port on which pgbouncer should listen to connect with clients. The default is 5432.
- `spec.connectionPool.adminUsers`: specifies the values of admin_users. An array of names of admin users are listed here.
- `spec.connectionPool.authType`: specifies how to authenticate users.
- `spec.connectionPool.poolMode`: specifies the value of pool_mode.
- `spec.connectionPool.maxClientConnections`: specifies the value of max_client_conn.
- `spec.connectionPool.defaultPoolSize`: specifies the value of default_pool_size.
- `spec.connectionPool.minPoolSize`: specifies the value of min_pool_size.
- `spec.connectionPool.reservePoolSize`: specifies the value of reserve_pool_size.
- `spec.connectionPool.reservePoolTimeout`: specifies the value of reserve_pool_timeout.
- `spec.connectionPool.maxDbConnections`: specifies the value of max_db_connections.
- `spec.connectionPool.maxUserConnections`: specifies the value of max_user_connections.

### spec.userListSecretRef

UserList field is used to specify a secret that contains the list of authorized users along with their passwords. Basically this secret is created from the standard pgbouncer userlist file.

- `spec.userListSecretRef.name`: specifies the name of the secret containing userlist in the same namespace as the PgBouncer crd.

In this tutorial we will use a standard userlist text file to create a secret for spec.userListSecretRef. In the userlist text file we have added `pgbouncer` as user and  `ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys` as corresponding password. The file looks like this:

```
"postgres" "ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys"
"myuser" "mypass"
```

We will need user `myuser` with password  `mypass` later in this tutorial.

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubedb/docs/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/pgbouncer/quickstart/userlist

2022-06-01 12:29:02 (1.02 MB/s) - ‘userlist’ saved [47/47]
$ kubectl create secret generic -n demo db-user-pass --from-file=./userlist.txt

secret/db-user-pass created
```
### spec.terminationPolicy

`terminationPolicy` gives flexibility whether to `nullify`(reject) the delete operation of `PgBouncer` crd or which resources KubeDB should keep or delete when you delete `PgBouncer` crd. KubeDB provides following four termination policies:

- DoNotTerminate
- Delete (`Default`)
- WipeOut

When `terminationPolicy` is `DoNotTerminate`, KubeDB takes advantage of `ValidationWebhook` feature in Kubernetes 1.9.0 or later clusters to provide safety from accidental deletion of database. If admission webhook is enabled, KubeDB prevents users from deleting the database as long as the `spec.terminationPolicy` is set to `DoNotTerminate`.

Following table show what KubeDB does when you delete Postgres crd for different termination policies,

| Behavior                  | DoNotTerminate | Delete   | WipeOut  |
|---------------------------| :------------: | :------: | :------: |
| 1. Block Delete operation |    &#10003;    | &#10007; | &#10007; |
| 2. Delete StatefulSet     |    &#10007;    | &#10003; | &#10003; |
| 3. Delete Services        |    &#10007;    | &#10003; | &#10003; |
| 4. Delete PVCs            |    &#10007;    | &#10003; | &#10003; |
| 5. Delete Secrets         |    &#10007;    | &#10007; | &#10003; |


Now that we've been introduced to the pgBouncer crd, let's create it,

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/pgbouncer/quickstart/pgbouncer-server.yaml

pgbouncer.kubedb.com/pgbouncer-server created
```

## Connect via PgBouncer

To connect via pgBouncer we have to expose its service to localhost.

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward -n demo svc/pgbouncer-server 5432

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:5432 -> 5432
Forwarding from [::1]:5432 -> 5432
```

Now, let's connect to `postgres` database via PgBouncer using psql.

``` bash
$ env PGPASSWORD=ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres postgres
psql (14.1 (Ubuntu 14.1-2.pgdg20.04+1), server 13.2)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# \q
```

If everything goes well, we'll be connected to the `postgres` database and be able to execute commands. Let's confirm if the company data we inserted in the  `postgres` database before are available via PgBouncer:

```bash
$ env PGPASSWORD=ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres postgres --command='SELECT * FROM company ORDER BY name;'
  name  | employee
--------+----------
 Apple  |       10
 Google |       15
(2 rows)
```

## Add New Connections to the Pool

We will add a new user and a new database to our PostgreSQL server `quick-postgres` and add this database to the existing pool and connect to this database using newly created user.

First lets create a new user `myuser` with password `mypass`

```bash
$ env PGPASSWORD=ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres postgres --command="create user myuser with encrypted password 'mypass'"
CREATE ROLE
```

And then create a new database `mydb`

```bash
$ env PGPASSWORD=ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres postgres --command="CREATE DATABASE mydb;"
CREATE DATABASE
```

And then grant privileges on database `mydb` to `myuser`

```bash
$ env PGPASSWORD=ZFopeLnwkSf_f5Ys psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres postgres --command="grant all privileges on database mydb to myuser"
GRANT
```


Now we will need to edit our PgBouncer's spec.databases to add this database to the connection pool.

The YAML file should now look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: PgBouncer
metadata:
  name: pgbouncer-server
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "1.17.0"
  replicas: 1
  databases:
  - alias: "postgres"
    databaseName: "postgres"
    databaseRef:
      name: "quick-postgres"
      namespace: demo
  - alias: "tmpdb"
    databaseName: "mydb"
    databaseRef:
      name: "quick-postgres"
      namespace: demo
  connectionPool:
    maxClientConnections: 20
    reservePoolSize: 5
    adminUsers:
    - admin
    - admin1
  userListSecretRef:
    name: db-user-pass
  terminationPolicy: Delete
```

We have given our newly added database an alias `tmpdb`.  We will now apply this modified file.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/pgbouncer/quickstart/pgbouncer-server-mod.yaml
pgbouncer.kubedb.com/pgbouncer-server configured
```

Let's try to connect to `mydb` via PgBouncer.

```bash
$ env PGPASSWORD=mypass psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=myuser tmpdb
psql (14.1 (Ubuntu 14.1-2.pgdg20.04+1), server 13.2)
Type "help" for help.

tmpdb=> 
```

We can now switch our connection between our existing databases `postgres` and `mydb` as well.

```bash
tmpdb=> \c postgres
psql (14.1 (Ubuntu 14.1-2.pgdg20.04+1), server 13.2)
You are now connected to database "postgres" as user "myuser".
postgres=> \c tmpdb
psql (14.1 (Ubuntu 14.1-2.pgdg20.04+1), server 13.2)
You are now connected to database "tmpdb" as user "myuser".
tmpdb=> \q
```

KubeDB operator watches for PgBouncer objects using Kubernetes api. When a PgBouncer object is created, KubeDB operator will create a new StatefulSet and a Service with the matching name. KubeDB operator will also create a governing service for StatefulSet with the name `kubedb`, if one is not already present.

KubeDB operator sets the `status.phase` to `Running` once the connection-pooling mechanism is ready.

```bash
$ kubectl get pb -n demo pgbouncer-server -o wide
NAME               VERSION   STATUS    AGE
pgbouncer-server   1.17.0    Ready     2h
```

Let's describe PgBouncer object `pgbouncer-server`

KubeDB has created a service for the PgBouncer object.

```bash
$ kubectl get service -n demo --selector=app.kubernetes.io/name=pgbouncers.kubedb.com,app.kubernetes.io/instance=pgbouncer-server
NAME                    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE

pgbouncer-server-pods   ClusterIP   None            <none>        5432/TCP   7m48s
```

Here, Service *`pgbouncer-server`* targets random pods to carry out connection-pooling.

## Cleaning up

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:
