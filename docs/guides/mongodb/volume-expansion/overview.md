# MongoDB Volume Expansion

This guide will give an overview on how KubeDB Ops-manager operator expand the volume of various component of `MongoDB` such as ReplicaSet, Shard, ConfigServer, Mongos, etc.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MongoDB](/docs/guides/mongodb/concepts/mongodb.md)
  - [MongoDBOpsRequest](/docs/guides/mongodb/concepts/opsrequest.md)

## How Volume Expansion Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB Ops-manager operator expand the volumes of `MongoDB` database components. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The Volume Expansion process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `MongoDB` Custom Resource (CR).

2. `KubeDB` Provisioner  operator watches the `MongoDB` CR.

3. When the operator finds a `MongoDB` CR, it creates required number of `StatefulSets` and related necessary stuff like secrets, services, etc.

4. Each StatefulSet creates a Persistent Volume according to the Volume Claim Template provided in the statefulset configuration. This Persistent Volume will be expanded by the `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator.

5. Then, in order to expand the volume of the various components (ie. ReplicaSet, Shard, ConfigServer, Mongos, etc.) of the `MongoDB` database the user creates a `MongoDBOpsRequest` CR with desired information.

6. `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator watches the `MongoDBOpsRequest` CR.

7. When it finds a `MongoDBOpsRequest` CR, it halts the `MongoDB` object which is referred from the `MongoDBOpsRequest`. So, the `KubeDB` Provisioner  operator doesn't perform any operations on the `MongoDB` object during the volume expansion process.

8. Then the `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator will expand the persistent volume to reach the expected size defined in the `MongoDBOpsRequest` CR.

9. After the successfully expansion of the volume of the related StatefulSet Pods, the `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator updates the new volume size in the `MongoDB` object to reflect the updated state.

10. After the successful Volume Expansion of the `MongoDB` components, the `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator resumes the `MongoDB` object so that the `KubeDB` Provisioner  operator resumes its usual operations.

In the next docs, we are going to show a step by step guide on Volume Expansion of various MongoDB database components using `MongoDBOpsRequest` CRD.
