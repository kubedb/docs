# Backup and Restore standalone PostgreSQL database using Stash

Stash 0.9.0+ supports backup and restoration of PostgreSQL databases. This guide will show you how you can backup and restore your PostgreSQL database with Stash.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube.
- Install KubeDB in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).
- Install Stash in your cluster following the steps [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/setup/install/stash/).
- Install Stash `kubectl` plugin following the steps [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/setup/install/kubectl-plugin/).
- If you are not familiar with how Stash backup and restore PostgreSQL databases, please check the following guide [here](/docs/guides/postgres/backup/overview/index.md):

You have to be familiar with following custom resources:

- [AppBinding](/docs/guides/postgres/concepts/appbinding.md)
- [Function](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/function/)
- [Task](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/task/)
- [BackupConfiguration](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/backupconfiguration/)
- [RestoreSession](https://stash.run/docs/latest/concepts/crds/restoresession/)

To keep things isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial. Create the `demo` namespace if you haven't created it already.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Backup PostgreSQL

This section will demonstrate how to backup a PostgreSQL database. Here, we are going to deploy a PostgreSQL database using KubeDB. Then, we are going to backup this database into a GCS bucket. Finally, we are going to restore the backed-up data into another PostgreSQL database.

### Deploy Sample PostgreSQL Database

Let's deploy a sample PostgreSQL database and insert some data into it.

**Create Postgres CRD:**

Below is the YAML of a sample Postgres crd that we are going to create for this tutorial:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Postgres
metadata:
  name: sample-postgres
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "11.22"
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
  terminationPolicy: Delete
```

Create the above `Postgres` crd,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/postgres/backup/standalone/examples/postgres.yaml
postgres.kubedb.com/sample-postgres created
```

KubeDB will deploy a PostgreSQL database according to the above specification. It will also create the necessary secrets and services to access the database.

Let's check if the database is ready to use,

```bash
❯ kubectl get pg -n demo sample-postgres
NAME              VERSION   STATUS   AGE
sample-postgres   11.11     Ready    50s
```

The database is `Ready`. Verify that KubeDB has created a Secret and a Service for this database using the following commands,

```bash
❯ kubectl get secret -n demo -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=sample-postgres
NAME                   TYPE                       DATA   AGE
sample-postgres-auth   kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      2m42s


❯ kubectl get service -n demo -l=app.kubernetes.io/instance=sample-postgres
NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
sample-postgres        ClusterIP   10.96.242.0   <none>        5432/TCP   3m9s
sample-postgres-pods   ClusterIP   None          <none>        5432/TCP   3m9s
```

Here, we have to use the service `sample-postgres` and secret `sample-postgres-auth` to connect with the database. KubeDB creates an [AppBinding](/docs/guides/postgres/concepts/appbinding.md) crd that holds the necessary information to connect with the database.

**Verify AppBinding:**

Verify that the `AppBinding` has been created successfully using the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get appbindings -n demo
NAME              TYPE                  VERSION   AGE
sample-postgres   kubedb.com/postgres   11.11      3m54s
```

Let's check the YAML of the above `AppBinding`,

```bash
❯ kubectl get appbindings -n demo sample-postgres -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: AppBinding
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: database
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: sample-postgres
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubedb.com
    app.kubernetes.io/name: postgreses.kubedb.com
  name: sample-postgres
  namespace: demo
  ...
spec:
  clientConfig:
    service:
      name: sample-postgres
      path: /
      port: 5432
      query: sslmode=disable
      scheme: postgresql
  secret:
    name: sample-postgres-auth
  parameters:
    apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
    kind: StashAddon
    stash:
      addon:
        backupTask:
          name: postgres-backup-11.9
        restoreTask:
          name: postgres-restore-11.9
  type: kubedb.com/postgres
  version: "11.22"
```

Stash uses the `AppBinding` crd to connect with the target database. It requires the following two fields to set in AppBinding's `Spec` section.

- `spec.clientConfig.service.name` specifies the name of the service that connects to the database.
- `spec.secret` specifies the name of the secret that holds necessary credentials to access the database.
- `spec.parameters.stash` specifies the Stash Addons that will be used to backup and restore this database.
- `spec.type` specifies the types of the app that this AppBinding is pointing to. KubeDB generated AppBinding follows the following format: `<app group>/<app resource type>`.

**Insert Sample Data:**

Now, we are going to exec into the database pod and create some sample data. At first, find out the database pod using the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get pods -n demo --selector="app.kubernetes.io/instance=sample-postgres"
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sample-postgres-0   1/1     Running   0          18m
```

Now, let's exec into the pod and create a table,

```bash
❯ kubectl exec -it -n demo sample-postgres-0 -- sh

# login as "postgres" superuser.
/ # psql -U postgres
psql (11.11)
Type "help" for help.

# list available databases
postgres=# \l
                                 List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    |   Access privileges
-----------+----------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 |
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
(3 rows)

# create a database named "demo"
postgres=# create database demo;
CREATE DATABASE

# verify that the "demo" database has been created
postgres=# \l
                                 List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
 demo      | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
(4 rows)

# connect to the "demo" database
postgres=# \c demo
You are now connected to database "demo" as user "postgres".

# create a sample table
demo=# CREATE TABLE COMPANY( NAME TEXT NOT NULL, EMPLOYEE INT NOT NULL);
CREATE TABLE

# verify that the table has been created
demo=# \d
          List of relations
 Schema |  Name   | Type  |  Owner   
--------+---------+-------+----------
 public | company | table | postgres
(1 row)

# quit from the database
demo=# \q

# exit from the pod
/ # exit
```

Now, we are ready to backup this sample database.

### Prepare Backend

We are going to store our backed-up data into a GCS bucket. At first, we need to create a secret with GCS credentials then we need to create a `Repository` crd. If you want to use a different backend, please read the respective backend configuration doc from [here](https://stash.run/docs/latest/guides/backends/overview/).

**Create Storage Secret:**

Let's create a secret called `gcs-secret` with access credentials to our desired GCS bucket,

```bash
$ echo -n 'changeit' > RESTIC_PASSWORD
$ echo -n '<your-project-id>' > GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
$ cat downloaded-sa-key.json > GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
$ kubectl create secret generic -n demo gcs-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
secret/gcs-secret created
```

**Create Repository:**

Now, crete a `Repository` using this secret. Below is the YAML of Repository crd we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: gcs-repo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-testing
      prefix: demo/postgres/sample-postgres
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
```

Let's create the `Repository` we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/postgres/backup/standalone/examples/repository.yaml
repository.stash.appscode.com/gcs-repo created
```

Now, we are ready to backup our database to our desired backend.

### Backup

We have to create a `BackupConfiguration` targeting the respective AppBinding object of our desired database. Stash will create a CronJob to periodically backup the database.

**Create BackupConfiguration:**

Below is the YAML for `BackupConfiguration` crd to backup the `sample-postgres` database we have deployed earlier.,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupConfiguration
metadata:
  name: sample-postgres-backup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  repository:
    name: gcs-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: sample-postgres
  retentionPolicy:
    name: keep-last-5
    keepLast: 5
    prune: true
```

Here,

- `spec.schedule` specifies that we want to backup the database at 5 minutes interval.
- `spec.repository.name` specifies the name of the `Repository` crd the holds the backend information where the backed up data will be stored.
- `spec.target.ref` refers to the `AppBinding` crd that was created for `sample-postgres` database.
- `spec.retentionPolicy`  specifies the policy to follow for cleaning old snapshots.

Let's create the `BackupConfiguration` object we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/postgres/backup/standalone/examples/backupconfiguration.yaml
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-postgres-backup created
```

**Verify Backup Setup Successful:**

If everything goes well, the phase of the `BackupConfiguration` should be `Ready`. The `Ready` phase indicates that the backup setup is successful. Let's verify the `Phase` of the BackupConfiguration,

```bash
$ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo
NAME                     TASK                   SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE      AGE
sample-postgres-backup   postgres-backup-11.9   */5 * * * *            Ready      11s
```

**Verify CronJob:**

Stash will create a CronJob with the schedule specified in `spec.schedule` field of `BackupConfiguration` crd.

Verify that the CronJob has been created using the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get cronjob -n demo
NAME                                  SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
stash-backup-sample-postgres-backup   */5 * * * *   False     0        <none>          30s
```

**Wait for BackupSession:**

The `sample-postgres-backup` CronJob will trigger a backup on each scheduled slot by creating a `BackupSession` crd.

Wait for a schedule to appear. Run the following command to watch `BackupSession` crd,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupsession -n demo -w
NAME                                INVOKER-TYPE          INVOKER-NAME             PHASE       AGE
sample-postgres-backup-1613390711   BackupConfiguration   sample-postgres-backup   Running     15s
sample-postgres-backup-1613390711   BackupConfiguration   sample-postgres-backup   Succeeded   78s
```

We can see above that the backup session has succeeded. Now, we are going to verify that the backed up data has been stored in the backend.

**Verify Backup:**

Once a backup is complete, Stash will update the respective `Repository` object to reflect the backup completion. Check that the repository `gcs-repo` has been updated by the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get repository -n demo gcs-repo
NAME       INTEGRITY   SIZE        SNAPSHOT-COUNT   LAST-SUCCESSFUL-BACKUP   AGE
gcs-repo   true        1.770 KiB   1                2m                       4m16s
```

Now, if we navigate to the GCS bucket, we are going to see backed up data has been stored in `demo/postgres/sample-postgres` directory as specified by `spec.backend.gcs.prefix` field of Repository crd.

<figure align="center">
 <img alt="Backup data in GCS Bucket" src="/docs/guides/postgres/backup/standalone/images/sample-postgres-backup.png">
  <figcaption align="center">Fig: Backup data in GCS Bucket</figcaption>
</figure>

> Note: Stash keeps all the backed-up data encrypted. So, data in the backend will not make any sense until they are decrypted.

## Restore PostgreSQL

Now, we are going to restore the database from the backup we have taken in the previous section. We are going to deploy a new database and initialize it from the backup.

#### Stop Taking Backup of the Old Database:

At first, let's stop taking any further backup of the old database so that no backup is taken during the restore process. We are going to pause the `BackupConfiguration` crd that we had created to backup the `sample-postgres` database. Then, Stash will stop taking any further backup for this database.

Let's pause the `sample-postgres-backup` BackupConfiguration,
```bash
❯ kubectl patch backupconfiguration -n demo sample-postgres-backup --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"paused": true}}'
backupconfiguration.stash.appscode.com/sample-postgres-backup patched
```

Or you can use the Stash `kubectl` plugin to pause the `BackupConfiguration`,
```bash
❯ kubectl stash pause backup -n demo --backupconfig=sample-postgres-backup
BackupConfiguration demo/sample-postgres-backup has been paused successfully.
```

Now, wait for a moment. Stash will pause the BackupConfiguration. Verify that the BackupConfiguration  has been paused,

```bash
❯ kubectl get backupconfiguration -n demo sample-postgres-backup
NAME                    TASK                      SCHEDULE      PAUSED   PHASE   AGE
sample-postgres-backup  postgres-backup-11.9      */5 * * * *   true     Ready   5m55s
```

Notice the `PAUSED` column. Value `true` for this field means that the BackupConfiguration has been paused.

#### Deploy Restored Database:

Now, we are going to deploy the restored database similarly as we have deployed the original `sample-psotgres` database.

Below is the YAML for `Postgres` crd we are going deploy to initialize from backup,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Postgres
metadata:
  name: restored-postgres
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "11.22"
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
  init:
    waitForInitialRestore: true
  terminationPolicy: Delete

```

Notice the `init` section. Here, we have specified `waitForInitialRestore: true` which tells KubeDB to wait for the first restore to complete before marking this database as ready to use.

Let's create the above database,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/postgres/backup/standalone/examples/restored-postgres.yaml
postgres.kubedb.com/restored-postgres created
```

This time, the database will get stuck in the `Provisioning` state because we haven't restored the data yet.

```bash
❯ kubectl get postgres -n demo restored-postgres
NAME                VERSION   STATUS         AGE
restored-postgres   11.11     Provisioning   6m7s
```

You can check the log from the database pod to be sure whether the database is ready to accept connections or not.

```bash
❯ kubectl logs -n demo restored-postgres-0
....
2021-02-15 12:36:31.087 UTC [19] LOG:  listening on IPv4 address "0.0.0.0", port 5432
2021-02-15 12:36:31.087 UTC [19] LOG:  listening on IPv6 address "::", port 5432
2021-02-15 12:36:31.094 UTC [19] LOG:  listening on Unix socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"
2021-02-15 12:36:31.121 UTC [50] LOG:  database system was shut down at 2021-02-15 12:36:31 UTC
2021-02-15 12:36:31.126 UTC [19] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
```

As you can see from the above log that the database is ready to accept connections. Now, we can start restoring this database.

#### Create RestoreSession:

Now, we need to create a `RestoreSession` object pointing to the AppBinding for this restored database.

Check AppBinding has been created for the `restored-postgres` database using the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get appbindings -n demo restored-postgres
NAME                TYPE                  VERSION   AGE
restored-postgres   kubedb.com/postgres   11.11   6m45s
```

> If you are not using KubeDB to deploy the database, then create the AppBinding manually.

Below is the YAML for the `RestoreSession` crd that we are going to create to restore backed up data into `restored-postgres` database.

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: RestoreSession
metadata:
  name: sample-postgres-restore
  namespace: demo
spec:
  repository:
    name: gcs-repo
  target:
    ref:
      apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
      kind: AppBinding
      name: restored-postgres
  rules:
  - snapshots: [latest]
```

Here,

- `spec.repository.name` specifies the `Repository` crd that holds the backend information where our backed up data has been stored.
- `spec.target.ref` refers to the AppBinding crd for the `restored-postgres` database where the backed up data will be restored.
- `spec.rules` specifies that we are restoring from the latest backup snapshot of the original database.

Let's create the `RestoreSession` crd we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/postgres/backup/standalone/examples/restoresession.yaml
restoresession.stash.appscode.com/sample-postgres-restore created
```

Once, you have created the `RestoreSession` object, Stash will create a job to restore the database. We can watch the `RestoreSession` phase to check whether the restore process has succeeded or not.

Run the following command to watch `RestoreSession` phase,

```bash
❯ kubectl get restoresession -n demo -w
NAME                      REPOSITORY   PHASE     AGE
sample-postgres-restore   gcs-repo     Running   4s
sample-postgres-restore   gcs-repo     Running   15s
sample-postgres-restore   gcs-repo     Succeeded   15s
sample-postgres-restore   gcs-repo     Succeeded   15s
```

So, we can see from the output of the above command that the restore process succeeded.

#### Verify Restored Data:

In this section, we are going to verify that the desired data has been restored successfully. We are going to connect to the database and check whether the table we had created in the original database has been restored or not.

At first, check if the database has gone into `Ready` state using the following command,

```bash
❯ kubectl get pg -n demo restored-postgres
NAME                VERSION   STATUS   AGE
restored-postgres   11.11     Ready    11m
```

Now, exec into the database pod and verify restored data.

```bash
❯ kubectl exec -it -n demo restored-postgres-0 -- /bin/sh
# login as "postgres" superuser.
/ # psql -U postgres
psql (11.11)
Type "help" for help.

# verify that the "demo" database has been restored
postgres=# \l
                                 List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
 demo      | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
(4 rows)

# connect to the "demo" database
postgres=# \c demo
You are now connected to database "demo" as user "postgres".

# verify that the sample table has been restored
demo=# \d
          List of relations
 Schema |  Name   | Type  |  Owner   
--------+---------+-------+----------
 public | company | table | postgres
(1 row)

# disconnect from the database
demo=# \q

# exit from the pod
/ # exit
```

So, from the above output, we can see the `demo` database we had created in the original database `sample-postgres` has been restored in the `restored-postgres` database.

## Cleanup

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```bash
kubectl delete -n demo backupconfiguration sample-postgres-backup
kubectl delete -n demo restoresession sample-postgres-restore
kubectl delete -n demo postgres sample-postgres restored-postgres
kubectl delete -n demo repository gcs-repo
```
