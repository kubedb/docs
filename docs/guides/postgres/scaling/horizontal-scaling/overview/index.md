# Horizontal Scaling Overview

This guide will give you an overview of how KubeDB enterprise operator scales up/down the number of members of a `Postgres` instance.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [Postgres](/docs/guides/postgres/concepts/postgres.md)
  - [PostgresOpsRequest](/docs/guides/postgres/concepts/opsrequest.md)

## How Horizontal Scaling Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB enterprise operator used to scale up the number of members of a `Postgres` cluster. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The horizontal scaling process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `Postgres` cr.

2. `KubeDB` community operator watches for the `Postgres` cr.

3. When it finds one, it creates a `StatefulSet` and related necessary stuff like secret, service, etc.

4. Then, in order to scale the cluster, the user creates a `PostgresOpsRequest` cr with the desired number of members after scaling.

5. `KubeDB` enterprise operator watches for `PostgresOpsRequest`.

6. When it finds one, it halts the `Postgres` object so that the `KubeDB` community operator doesn't perform any operation on the `Postgres` during the scaling process.  

7. Then `KubeDB` enterprise operator will add nodes in case of scale up or remove nodes in case of scale down.

8. Then the `KubeDB` enterprise operator will scale the StatefulSet replicas to reach the expected number of replicas for the cluster.

9.  After successful scaling of the StatefulSet's replica, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator updates the `spec.replicas` field of `Postgres` object to reflect the updated cluster state.

10. After successful scaling of the `Postgres` replicas, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator resumes the `Postgres` object so that the `KubeDB` community operator can resume its usual operations.

In the next doc, we are going to show a step by step guide on scaling of a Postgres cluster using Horizontal Scaling.
