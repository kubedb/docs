# Horizontal Scale Postgres Cluster

This guide will show you how to use `KubeDB` Ops Manager to increase/decrease the number of members of a `Postgres` Cluster.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- Install `KubeDB` in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [Postgres](/docs/guides/postgres/concepts/postgres.md)
  - [PostgresOpsRequest](/docs/guides/postgres/concepts/opsrequest.md)
  - [Horizontal Scaling Overview](/docs/guides/postgres/scaling/horizontal-scaling/overview/index.md)

To keep everything isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

> **Note:** YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/guides/postgres/scaling/horizontal-scaling/scale-horizontally/yamls](https://github.com/kubedb/docs/tree/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/postgres/scaling/horizontal-scaling/scale-horizontally/yamls) directory of [kubedb/doc](https://github.com/kubedb/docs) repository.

### Apply Horizontal Scaling on Postgres Cluster

Here, we are going to deploy a `Postgres` Cluster using a supported version by `KubeDB` operator. Then we are going to apply horizontal scaling on it.

#### Prepare Cluster

At first, we are going to deploy a Cluster server with 3 members. Then, we are going to add two additional members through horizontal scaling. Finally, we will remove 1 member from the cluster again via horizontal scaling.

**Find supported Postgres Version:**

When you have installed `KubeDB`, it has created `PostgresVersion` CR for all supported `Postgres` versions. Let's check the supported Postgres versions,

```bash
$ kubectl get postgresversion
NAME                       VERSION   DISTRIBUTION   DB_IMAGE                               DEPRECATED   AGE

```

The version above that does not show `DEPRECATED` `true` is supported by `KubeDB` for `Postgres`. You can use any non-deprecated version. Here, we are going to create a Postgres Cluster using `Postgres` `13.2`.

**Deploy Postgres Cluster:**

In this section, we are going to deploy a Postgres Cluster with 3 members. Then, in the next section we will scale-up the cluster using horizontal scaling. Below is the YAML of the `Postgres` cr that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Postgres
metadata:
  name: pg
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "13.13"
  replicas: 3
  standbyMode: Hot
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

Let's create the `Postgres` cr we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/postgres/scaling/horizontal-scaling/scale-horizontally/postgres.yaml
postgres.kubedb.com/pg created
```

**Wait for the cluster to be ready:**

`KubeDB` operator watches for `Postgres` objects using Kubernetes API. When a `Postgres` object is created, `KubeDB` operator will create a new StatefulSet, Services, and Secrets, etc. A secret called `pg-auth` (format: <em>{postgres-object-name}-auth</em>) will be created storing the password for postgres superuser.
Now, watch `Postgres` is going to `Running` state and also watch `StatefulSet` and its pod is created and going to `Running` state,

```bash
$ watch -n 3 kubectl get postgres -n demo pg
Every 3.0s: kubectl get postgres -n demo pg                        emon-r7: Thu Dec  2 15:31:16 2021

NAME   VERSION   STATUS   AGE
pg     13.2      Ready    4h40m


$ watch -n 3 kubectl get sts -n demo pg
Every 3.0s: kubectl get sts -n demo pg                             emon-r7: Thu Dec  2 15:31:38 2021

NAME   READY   AGE
pg     3/3     4h41m



$ watch -n 3 kubectl get pods -n demo
Every 3.0s: kubectl get pod -n demo                                emon-r7: Thu Dec  2 15:33:24 2021

NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pg-0   2/2     Running   0          4h25m
pg-1   2/2     Running   0          4h26m
pg-2   2/2     Running   0          4h26m

```

Let's verify that the StatefulSet's pods have joined into cluster,

```bash
$ kubectl get secrets -n demo pg-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\username}' | base64 -d
postgres

$ kubectl get secrets -n demo pg-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -d
b3b5838EhjwsiuFU

```

So, we can see that our cluster has 3 members. Now, we are ready to apply the horizontal scale to this Postgres cluster.

#### Scale Up

Here, we are going to add 2 replicas in our Cluster using horizontal scaling.

**Create PostgresOpsRequest:**

To scale up your cluster, you have to create a `PostgresOpsRequest` cr with your desired number of replicas after scaling. Below is the YAML of the `PostgresOpsRequest` cr that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: PostgresOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: pg-scale-horizontal
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: HorizontalScaling
  databaseRef:
    name: pg
  horizontalScaling:
    replicas: 5
```

Here,

- `spec.databaseRef.name` specifies that we are performing operation on `pg` `Postgres` database.
- `spec.type` specifies that we are performing `HorizontalScaling` on our database.
- `spec.horizontalScaling.replicas` specifies the expected number of replicas after the scaling.

Let's create the `PostgresOpsRequest` cr we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/postgres/scaling/horizontal-scaling/scale-horizontally/yamls/pg-scale-up.yaml
postgresopsrequest.ops.kubedb.com/pg-scale-up created
```

**Verify Scale-Up Succeeded:**

If everything goes well, `KubeDB` Ops Manager will scale up the StatefulSet's `Pod`. After the scaling process is completed successfully, the `KubeDB` Ops Manager updates the replicas of the `Postgres` object.

First, we will wait for `PostgresOpsRequest` to be successful. Run the following command to watch `PostgresOpsRequest` cr,

```bash
$ watch kubectl get postgresopsrequest -n demo pg-scale-up
Every 2.0s: kubectl get postgresopsrequest -n demo pg-scale-up     emon-r7: Thu Dec  2 17:57:36 2021

NAME          TYPE                STATUS       AGE
pg-scale-up   HorizontalScaling   Successful   8m23s

```

You can see from the above output that the `PostgresOpsRequest` has succeeded. If we describe the `PostgresOpsRequest`, we will see that the `Postgres` cluster is scaled up.

```bash
kubectl describe postgresopsrequest -n demo pg-scale-up

```

Now, we are going to verify whether the number of members has increased to meet up the desired state. So let's check the new pods logs to see if they have joined in the cluster as new replica.

```bash
$ kubectl logs   -n demo                 pg-4  -c postgres -f
waiting for the role to be decided ...

```

You can see above that this pod is streaming wal from primary as replica. It verifies that we have successfully scaled up.

#### Scale Down

Here, we are going to remove 1 replica from our cluster using horizontal scaling.

**Create PostgresOpsRequest:**

To scale down your cluster, you have to create a `PostgresOpsRequest` cr with your desired number of members after scaling. Below is the YAML of the `PostgresOpsRequest` cr that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: PostgresOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: pg-scale-down
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: HorizontalScaling
  databaseRef:
    name: pg
  horizontalScaling:
    replicas: 4
```

Let's create the `PostgresOpsRequest` cr we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/postgres/scaling/horizontal-scaling/scale-horizontally/yamls/pg-scale-down.yaml
postgresopsrequest.ops.kubedb.com/pg-scale-down created
```

**Verify Scale-down Succeeded:**

If everything goes well, `KubeDB` Ops Manager will scale down the StatefulSet's `Pod`. After the scaling process is completed successfully, the `KubeDB` Ops Manager updates the replicas of the `Postgres` object.

Now, we will wait for `PostgresOpsRequest` to be successful. Run the following command to watch `PostgresOpsRequest` cr,

```bash
$ watch kubectl get postgresopsrequest -n demo pg-scale-down
Every 2.0s: kubectl get postgresopsrequest -n demo pg-scale-down    emon-r7: Thu Dec  2 18:15:37 2021

NAME            TYPE                STATUS       AGE
pg-scale-down   HorizontalScaling   Successful   115s


```

You can see from the above output that the `PostgresOpsRequest` has succeeded. If we describe the `PostgresOpsRequest`, we shall see that the `Postgres` cluster is scaled down.

```bash
$ kubectl describe  postgresopsrequest -n demo pg-scale-down
Name:         pg-scale-down

Now, we are going to verify whether the number of members has decreased to meet up the desired state, Let's check, the postgres status if it's ready then the scale-down is successful.

```bash
$ kubectl get postgres -n demo pg
Every 3.0s: kubectl get postgres -n demo pg                         emon-r7: Thu Dec  2 18:16:39 2021

NAME   VERSION   STATUS   AGE
pg     13.2      Ready    7h26m

```

You can see above that our `Postgres` cluster now has a total of 4 members. It verifies that we have successfully scaled down.

## Cleaning Up

To clean up the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```bash
kubectl delete pg -n demo pg
kubectl delete postgresopsrequest -n demo pg-scale-up
kubectl delete postgresopsrequest -n demo pg-scale-down
```
