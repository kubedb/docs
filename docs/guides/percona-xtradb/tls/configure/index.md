# Configure TLS/SSL in PerconaXtraDB

`KubeDB` supports providing TLS/SSL encryption (via, `requireSSL` mode) for `PerconaXtraDB`. This tutorial will show you how to use `KubeDB` to deploy a `PerconaXtraDB` database with TLS/SSL configuration.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- Install [`cert-manger`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) v1.9.0 or later to your cluster to manage your SSL/TLS certificates.

- Install `KubeDB` community and enterprise operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).

- To keep things isolated, this tutorial uses a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

  ```bash
  $ kubectl create ns demo
  namespace/demo created
  ```

> Note: YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/guides/percona-xtradb/tls/configure/examples](https://github.com/kubedb/docs/tree/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/mysql/tls/configure/yamls) folder in GitHub repository [kubedb/docs](https://github.com/kubedb/docs).

### Deploy PerconaXtraDB database with TLS/SSL configuration

As pre-requisite, at first, we are going to create an Issuer/ClusterIssuer. This Issuer/ClusterIssuer is used to create certificates. Then we are going to deploy a PerconaXtraDB standalone and a group replication that will be configured with these certificates by `KubeDB` operator.

### Create Issuer/ClusterIssuer

Now, we are going to create an example `Issuer` that will be used throughout the duration of this tutorial. Alternatively, you can follow this [cert-manager tutorial](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ca/) to create your own `Issuer`. By following the below steps, we are going to create our desired issuer,

- Start off by generating our ca-certificates using openssl,

```bash
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./ca.key -out ./ca.crt -subj "/CN=perconaxtradb/O=kubedb"
Generating a RSA private key
...........................................................................+++++
........................................................................................................+++++
writing new private key to './ca.key'
```

- create a secret using the certificate files we have just generated,

```bash
kubectl create secret tls px-ca \
     --cert=ca.crt \
     --key=ca.key \
     --namespace=demo
secret/px-ca created
```

Now, we are going to create an `Issuer` using the `px-ca` secret that hols the ca-certificate we have just created. Below is the YAML of the `Issuer` cr that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: px-issuer
  namespace: demo
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: px-ca
```

Letâ€™s create the `Issuer` cr we have shown above,

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/percona-xtradb/tls/configure/examples/issuer.yaml
issuer.cert-manager.io/px-issuer created
```

## Deploy PerconaXtraDB Cluster with TLS/SSL configuration

Now, we are going to deploy a `PerconaXtraDB` Cluster with TLS/SSL configuration. Below is the YAML for PerconaXtraDB cluster that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: PerconaXtraDB
metadata:
  name: sample-pxc
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "8.0.26"
  replicas: 3
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi   
  requireSSL: true
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      apiGroup: cert-manager.io
      kind: Issuer
      name: px-issuer
    certificates:
    - alias: server
      subject:
        organizations:
        - kubedb:server
      dnsNames:
      - localhost
      ipAddresses:
      - "127.0.0.1"
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

**Deploy PerconaXtraDB Cluster:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/percona-xtradb/tls/configure/examples/tls-cluster.yaml
perconaxtradb.kubedb.com/sample-pxc created
```

**Wait for the database to be ready :**

Now, wait for `PerconaXtraDB` going on `Running` state and also wait for `StatefulSet` and its pods to be created and going to `Running` state,

```bash
$ kubectl get perconaxtradb -n demo sample-pxc
NAME         VERSION   STATUS   AGE
sample-pxc   8.0.26    Ready    3m23s


$ kubectl get pod -n demo | grep sample-pxc
sample-pxc-0   2/2     Running   0          3m32s
sample-pxc-1   2/2     Running   0          3m32s
sample-pxc-2   2/2     Running   0          3m32s
```

**Verify tls-secrets created successfully :**

If everything goes well, you can see that our tls-secrets will be created which contains server, client, exporter certificate. Server tls-secret will be used for server configuration and client tls-secret will be used for a secure connection.

All tls-secret are created by `KubeDB` enterprise operator. Default tls-secret name formed as _{perconaxtradb-object-name}-{cert-alias}-cert_.

Let's check the tls-secrets have created,

```bash
$ kubectl get secrets -n demo | grep sample-pxc
sample-pxc-auth                    kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      4m18s
sample-pxc-client-cert             kubernetes.io/tls                     3      4m19s
sample-pxc-metrics-exporter-cert   kubernetes.io/tls                     3      4m18s
sample-pxc-monitor                 kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      4m18s
sample-pxc-replication             kubernetes.io/basic-auth              2      4m18s
sample-pxc-server-cert             kubernetes.io/tls                     3      4m18s
sample-pxc-token-84hrj             kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      4m19s

```

**Verify PerconaXtraDB Cluster configured with TLS/SSL:**

Now, we are going to connect to the database for verifying the `PerconaXtraDB` server has configured with TLS/SSL encryption.

Let's exec into the first pod to verify TLS/SSL configuration,

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it -n demo sample-pxc-0 -- bash
Defaulted container "perconaxtradb" out of: perconaxtradb, px-coordinator, px-init (init)
bash-4.4$ ls /etc/mysql/certs/client

bash-4.4$ mysql -u${MYSQL_ROOT_USERNAME} -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}

The above output shows that the `PerconaXtraDB` server is configured to TLS/SSL. You can also see that the `.crt` and `.key` files are stored in `/etc/mysql/certs/client/` and `/etc/mysql/certs/server/` directory for client and server respectively.

**Verify secure connection for SSL required user:**

Now, you can create an SSL required user that will be used to connect to the database with a secure connection.

Let's connect to the database server with a secure connection,

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it -n demo sample-pxc-0 -- bash

switching ssl off as it does not make connection via unix socket
any more secure.

```

From the above output, you can see that only using client certificate we can access the database securely, otherwise, it shows "Access denied". Our client certificate is stored in `/etc/mysql/certs/client/` directory.

## Cleaning up

To clean up the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```bash
$ kubectl delete  perconaxtradb demo  sample-pxc
perconaxtradb.kubedb.com "sample-pxc" deleted
$ kubectl delete ns demo
namespace "demo" deleted
```
