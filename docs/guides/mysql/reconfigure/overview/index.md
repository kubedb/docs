### Reconfiguring MySQL

This guide will give an overview on how KubeDB Ops Manager reconfigures `MySQL`.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MySQL](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/)
  - [MySQLOpsRequest](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/opsrequest)

## How Reconfiguring MySQL Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB Ops Manager reconfigures `MySQL` database components. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The Reconfiguring MySQL process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `MySQL` Custom Resource (CR).

2. `KubeDB` Community operator watches the `MySQL` CR.

3. When the operator finds a `MySQL` CR, it creates required number of `StatefulSets` and related necessary stuff like secrets, services, etc.

4. Then, in order to reconfigure the `MySQL` standalone or cluster the user creates a `MySQLOpsRequest` CR with desired information.

5. `KubeDB` Enterprise operator watches the `MySQLOpsRequest` CR.

6. When it finds a `MySQLOpsRequest` CR, it halts the `MySQL` object which is referred from the `MySQLOpsRequest`. So, the `KubeDB` Community operator doesn't perform any operations on the `MySQL` object during the reconfiguring process.  
   
7. Then the `KubeDB` Enterprise operator will replace the existing configuration with the new configuration provided or merge the new configuration with the existing configuration according to the `MySQLOpsRequest` CR.

8. Then the `KubeDB` Enterprise operator will restart the related StatefulSet Pods so that they restart with the new configuration defined in the `MySQLOpsRequest` CR.

9. After the successful reconfiguring of the `MySQL`, the `KubeDB` Enterprise operator resumes the `MySQL` object so that the `KubeDB` Community operator resumes its usual operations.

In the next docs, we are going to show a step by step guide on reconfiguring MySQL database components using `MySQLOpsRequest` CRD.
