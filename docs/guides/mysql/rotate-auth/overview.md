# Rotate Authentication of MySQL

This guide will give an overview on how KubeDB Ops-manager operator Rotate Authentication configuration.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
    - [MySQL](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/database/index.md)
    - [MySQLOpsRequest](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/opsrequest/index.md)

## How Rotate MySQL Authentication Configuration Process Works

The authentication rotation process for MySQL using KubeDB involves the following steps:

1. A user first creates a `MySQL` Custom Resource Object (CRO).

2. The `KubeDB Provisioner operator` continuously watches for `MySQL` CROs.

3. When the operator detects a `MySQL` CR, it provisions the required `PetSets`, along with related resources such as secrets, services, and other dependencies.

4. To initiate authentication rotation, the user creates a `MySQLOpsRequest` CR with the desired configuration.

5. The `KubeDB Ops-manager` operator watches for `MySQLOpsRequest` CRs.

6. Upon detecting a `MySQLOpsRequest`, the operator pauses the referenced `MySQL` object, ensuring that the Provisioner
   operator does not perform any operations during the authentication rotation process.

7. The `Ops-manager` operator then updates the necessary configuration (such as credentials) based on the provided `MySQLOpsRequest` specification.

8. After applying the updated configuration, the operator restarts all `MySQL` Pods so they come up with the new authentication environment variables and settings.

9. Once the authentication rotation is completed successfully, the operator resumes the `MySQL` object, allowing the Provisioner operator to continue its usual operations.

In the next section, we will walk you through a step-by-step guide to rotating MySQL authentication using the `MySQLOpsRequest` CRD.
