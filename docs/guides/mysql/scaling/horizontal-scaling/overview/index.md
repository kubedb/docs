# Horizontal Scaling Overview

This guide will give you an overview of how KubeDB enterprise operator scales up/down the number of members of a `MySQL` group replication.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MySQL](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/database/index.md)
  - [MySQLOpsRequest](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/opsrequest/index.md)

## How Horizontal Scaling Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB enterprise operator used to scale up the number of members of a `MySQL` group replication. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The horizontal scaling process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `MySQL` cr.

2. `KubeDB` community operator watches for the `MySQL` cr.

3. When it finds one, it creates a `StatefulSet` and related necessary stuff like secret, service, etc.

4. Then, in order to scale the cluster, the user creates a `MySQLOpsRequest` cr with the desired number of members after scaling.

5. `KubeDB` enterprise operator watches for `MySQLOpsRequest`.

6. When it finds one, it halts the `MySQL` object so that the `KubeDB` community operator doesn't perform any operation on the `MySQL` during the scaling process.  

7. Then the `KubeDB` enterprise operator will scale the StatefulSet replicas to reach the expected number of members for the group replication.

8. After successful scaling of the StatefulSet's replica, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator updates the `spec.replicas` field of `MySQL` object to reflect the updated cluster state.

9. After successful scaling of the `MySQL` replicas, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator resumes the `MySQL` object so that the `KubeDB` community operator can resume its usual operations.

In the next doc, we are going to show a step by step guide on scaling of a MySQL group replication using Horizontal Scaling.
