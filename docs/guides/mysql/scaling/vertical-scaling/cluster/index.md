# Vertical Scale MySQL Cluster

This guide will show you how to use `KubeDB` enterprise operator to update the resources of the members of a `MySQL` Cluster.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- Install `KubeDB` community and enterprise operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MySQL](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/database/index.md)
  - [MySQLOpsRequest](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/opsrequest/index.md)
  - [Vertical Scaling Overview](/docs/guides/mysql/scaling/vertical-scaling/overview/index.md)

To keep everything isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

> **Note:** YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/guides/mysql/scaling/vertical-scaling/cluster/yamls](https://github.com/kubedb/docs/tree/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/mysql/scaling/vertical-scaling/cluster/yamls) directory of [kubedb/doc](https://github.com/kubedb/docs) repository.

### Apply Vertical Scaling on MySQL Group Replication

Here, we are going to deploy a  `MySQL` group replication using a supported version by `KubeDB` operator. Then we are going to apply vertical scaling on it.

#### Prepare MySQL Cluster

At first, we are going to deploy a cluster using a supported `MySQL` version. Then, we are going to update the resources of the members through vertical scaling.

**Find supported MySQL Version:**

When you have installed `KubeDB`, it has created `MySQLVersion` CR for all supported `MySQL` versions.  Let's check the supported MySQL versions,

```bash
$ kubectl get mysqlversion
NAME            VERSION   DISTRIBUTION   DB_IMAGE                    DEPRECATED   AGE
5.7.35-v1       5.7.35    Official       mysql:5.7.35                             4d2h
5.7.41          5.7.41    Official       mysql:5.7.41                             4d2h
8.0.17          8.0.17    Official       mysql:8.0.17                             4d2h
8.0.32          8.0.32    Official       mysql:8.0.32                             4d2h
8.0.32-innodb   8.0.32    MySQL          mysql/mysql-server:8.0.32                4d2h
8.0.32          8.0.32    Official       mysql:8.0.32                             4d2h
8.0.3-v4        8.0.3     Official       mysql:8.0.3                              4d2h
8.0.31          8.0.31    Official       mysql:8.0.31                             4d2h
8.0.31-innodb   8.0.31    MySQL          mysql/mysql-server:8.0.31                4d2h
```

The version above that does not show `DEPRECATED` `true` is supported by `KubeDB` for `MySQL`. You can use any non-deprecated version. Here, we are going to create a MySQL Group Replication using non-deprecated `MySQL` version `8.0.31`.

**Deploy MySQL Cluster:**

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="definationTab" role="tablist">
  <li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link active" id="gr-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#groupReplication" role="tab" aria-controls="groupReplication" aria-selected="true">Group Replication</a>
  </li>

  <li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link" id="ic-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#innodbCluster" role="tab" aria-controls="innodbCluster" aria-selected="false">Innodb Cluster</a>
  </li>

  <li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link" id="sc-tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#semisync" role="tab" aria-controls="semisync" aria-selected="false">Semi sync </a>
  </li>

</ul>


<div class="tab-content" id="definationTabContent">
  <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="groupReplication" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="gr-tab">

In this section, we are going to deploy a MySQL group replication with 3 members. Then, in the next section we will update the resources of the members using vertical scaling. Below is the YAML of the `MySQL` cr that we are going to create,

```yaml

```

  </div>

</div>



**Wait for the cluster to be ready:**

`KubeDB` operator watches for `MySQL` objects using Kubernetes API. When a `MySQL` object is created, `KubeDB` operator will create a new StatefulSet, Services, and Secrets, etc.
Now, watch `MySQL` is going to  `Running` state and also watch `StatefulSet` and its pod is created and going to `Running` state,

```bash
$ watch -n 3 kubectl get my -n demo my-group
Every 3.0s: kubectl get my -n demo my-group                     suaas-appscode: Tue Jun 30 22:43:57 2020

NAME       VERSION   STATUS    AGE
my-group   8.0.31    Running   16m

$ watch -n 3 kubectl get sts -n demo my-group
Every 3.0s: kubectl get sts -n demo my-group                     Every 3.0s: kubectl get sts -n demo my-group                    suaas-appscode: Tue Jun 30 22:44:35 2020

NAME       READY   AGE
my-group   3/3     16m

$ watch -n 3 kubectl get pod -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mysqls.kubedb.com,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-group
Every 3.0s: kubectl get pod -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mysqls.kubedb.com  suaas-appscode: Tue Jun 30 22:45:33 2020

NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-group-0   2/2     Running   0          17m
my-group-1   2/2     Running   0          14m
my-group-2   2/2     Running   0          11m
```

Let's check one of the StatefulSet's pod containers resources,

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n demo my-group-0 -o json | jq '.spec.containers[1].resources'
{}
```

You can see that the Pod has empty resources that mean the scheduler will choose a random node to place the container of the Pod on by default. Now, we are ready to apply the vertical scale on this group replication.

#### Vertical Scaling

Here, we are going to update the resources of the database cluster to meet up with the desired resources after scaling.

**Create MySQLOpsRequest:**

In order to update the resources of your database cluster, you have to create a `MySQLOpsRequest` cr with your desired resources after scaling. Below is the YAML of the `MySQLOpsRequest` cr that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MySQLOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: my-scale-group
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: VerticalScaling  
  databaseRef:
    name: my-group
  verticalScaling:
    mysql:
      requests:
        memory: "1200Mi"
        cpu: "0.7"
      limits:
        memory: "1200Mi"
        cpu: "0.7"
```

Here,

- `spec.databaseRef.name` specifies that we are performing operation on `my-group` `MySQL` database.
- `spec.type` specifies that we are performing `VerticalScaling` on our database.
- `spec.VerticalScaling.mysql` specifies the expected mysql container resources after scaling.

Let's create the `MySQLOpsRequest` cr we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/mysql/scaling/vertical-scaling/cluster/yamls/my-scale-group.yaml
mysqlopsrequest.ops.kubedb.com/my-scale-group created
```

**Verify MySQL Group Replication resources updated successfully:**

If everything goes well, `KubeDB` enterprise operator will update the resources of the StatefulSet's `Pod` containers. After a successful scaling process is done, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator updates the resources of the `MySQL` cluster.

First, we will wait for `MySQLOpsRequest` to be successful.  Run the following command to watch `MySQlOpsRequest` cr,

```bash
$ watch -n 3 kubectl get myops -n demo my-scale-group
Every 3.0s: kubectl get myops -n demo my-sc...  suaas-appscode: Wed Aug 12 16:49:21 2020

NAME             TYPE              STATUS       AGE
my-scale-group   VerticalScaling   Successful   4m53s
```

You can see from the above output that the `MySQLOpsRequest` has succeeded. If we describe the `MySQLOpsRequest`, we shall see that the resources of the members of the `MySQL` group replication are updated.

```bash
$ kubectl describe myops -n demo my-scale-group

```

Now, we are going to verify whether the resources of the members of the cluster have updated to meet up the desired state, Let's check,

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n demo my-group-0 -o json | jq '.spec.containers[1].resources'
{
  "limits": {
    "cpu": "700m",
    "memory": "1200Mi"
  },
  "requests": {
    "cpu": "700m",
    "memory": "1200Mi"
  }
}
```

The above output verifies that we have successfully updated the resources of the `MySQL` group replication.

## Cleaning Up

To clean up the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```bash
kubectl delete my -n demo my-group
kubectl delete myops -n demo my-scale-group
```
