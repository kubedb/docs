# Upgrading MySQL version Overview

This guide will give you an overview of how KubeDB enterprise operator upgrades the version of `MySQL` database.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MySQL](/docs/concepts/databases/mysql.md)
  - [MySQLOpsRequest](/docs/concepts/day-2-operations/mysqlopsrequest.md)

## How Upgrade Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB enterprise operator used to upgrade the version of `MySQL`. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The upgrading process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `MySQL` cr.

2. `KubeDB` community operator watches for the `MySQL` cr.

3. When it finds one, it creates a `StatefulSet` and related necessary stuff like secret, service, etc.

4. Then, in order to upgrade the version of the `MySQL` database the user creates a `MySQLOpsRequest` cr with the desired version.

5. `KubeDB` enterprise operator watches for `MySQLOpsRequest`.

6. When it finds one, it pauses the `MySQL` object so that the `KubeDB` community operator doesn't perform any operation on the `MySQL` during the upgrading process.  

7. By looking at the target version from `MySQLOpsRequest` cr, `KubeDB` enterprise operator takes one of the following steps:
   - either update the images of the `StatefulSet` for upgrading between patch/minor versions.
   - or creates a new `StatefulSet` using targeted image for upgrading between major versions.

8. After successful upgradation of the `StatefulSet` and its `Pod` images, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator updates the image of the `MySQL` object to reflect the updated cluster state.

9. After successful upgradation of `MySQL` object, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator resumes the `MySQL` object so that the `KubeDB` community operator can resume its usual operations.

In the next doc, we are going to show a step by step guide on upgrading of a MySQL database using upgrade operation.
