# Upgrade major version of MySQL Group Replication

This guide will show you how to use `KubeDB` enterprise operator to upgrade the major version of `MySQL` Group Replication.

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- Install `KubeDB` community and enterprise operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md).

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MySQL](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/mysql.md)
  - [MySQLOpsRequest](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/opsrequest.md)
  - [Upgrading Overview](/docs/guides/mysql/upgrading/overview.md)

To keep everything isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

> **Note:** YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/examples/mysql](/docs/examples/mysql) directory of [kubedb/docs](https://github.com/kubedb/docs) repository.

### Apply Version Upgrading on Group Replication

Here, we are going to deploy a `MySQL` group replication using a supported version by `KubeDB` operator. Then we are going to apply upgrading on it.

#### Prepare Group Replication

At first, we are going to deploy a group replication using supported that `MySQL` version whether it is possible to upgrade from this version to another. In the next two sections, we are going to find out the supported version and version upgrade constraints.

**Find supported MySQL Version:**

When you have installed `KubeDB`, it has created `MySQLVersion` CR for all supported `MySQL` versions. Let’s check the supported `MySQL` versions,

```bash
$ kubectl get mysqlversion
NAME        VERSION   DB_IMAGE                 DEPRECATED   AGE
5           5         kubedb/mysql:5           true         149m
5-v1        5         kubedb/mysql:5-v1        true         149m
5.7         5.7       kubedb/mysql:5.7         true         149m

5.7-v2      5.7.25    kubedb/mysql:5.7-v2      true         149m
5.7-v3      5.7.25    kubedb/mysql:5.7.25      true         149m
5.7-v4      5.7.29    kubedb/mysql:5.7.29      true         149m
5.7.25      5.7.25    kubedb/mysql:5.7.25      true         149m
5.7.25-v1   5.7.25    kubedb/mysql:5.7.25-v1                149m
5.7.29      5.7.29    kubedb/mysql:5.7.29                   149m
5.7.31      5.7.31    kubedb/mysql:5.7.31                   149m
8           8         kubedb/mysql:8           true         149m
8-v1        8         kubedb/mysql:8-v1        true         149m
8.0         8.0       kubedb/mysql:8.0         true         149m
8.0-v1      8.0.3     kubedb/mysql:8.0-v1      true         149m
8.0-v2      8.0.14    kubedb/mysql:8.0-v2      true         149m
8.0-v3      8.0.20    kubedb/mysql:8.0.20      true         149m
8.0.14      8.0.14    kubedb/mysql:8.0.14      true         149m
8.0.14-v1   8.0.14    kubedb/mysql:8.0.14-v1                149m
8.0.20      8.0.20    kubedb/mysql:8.0.20                   149m
8.0.21      8.0.21    kubedb/mysql:8.0.21                   149m
8.0.3       8.0.3     kubedb/mysql:8.0.3       true         149m
8.0.3-v1    8.0.3     kubedb/mysql:8.0.3-v1                 149m
```

The version above that does not show `DEPRECATED` true is supported by `KubeDB` for `MySQL`. You can use any non-deprecated version. Now, we are going to select a non-deprecated version from `MySQLVersion` for `MySQL` group replication that will be possible to upgrade from this version to another version. In the next section, we are going to verify version upgrade constraints.

**Check Upgrade Constraints:**

Database version upgrade constraints is a constraint that shows whether it is possible or not possible to upgrade from one version to another. Let's check the version upgrade constraints of `MySQL` `5.7.31`,

```bash
$ kubectl get mysqlversion 5.7.31 -o yaml
apiVersion: catalog.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MySQLVersion
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2020-08-12T08:28:09Z"
  generation: 1
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: kubedb-catalog
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
    app.kubernetes.io/name: kubedb-catalog
    app.kubernetes.io/version: v0.14.0-beta.1
    helm.sh/chart: kubedb-catalog-v0.14.0-beta.1
  ...
    operation: Update
    time: "2020-08-12T08:28:09Z"
  name: 5.7.31
  resourceVersion: "42252"
  selfLink: /apis/catalog.kubedb.com/v1alpha1/mysqlversions/5.7.31
  uid: 4d1cfcf0-ac49-484f-83c3-38ff724d13c7
spec:
  db:
    image: kubedb/mysql:5.7.31
  exporter:
    image: kubedb/mysqld-exporter:v0.11.0
  initContainer:
    image: kubedb/busybox
  podSecurityPolicies:
    databasePolicyName: mysql-db
  replicationModeDetector:
    image: kubedb/mysql-replication-mode-detector:v0.1.0-beta.1
  tools:
    image: kubedb/mysql-tools:5.7.25
  upgradeConstraints:
    denylist:
      groupReplication:
      - < 5.7.31
      standalone:
      - < 5.7.31
  version: 5.7.31
```

The above `spec.upgradeConstraints.denylist` of `5.7.31` is showing that upgrading below version of `5.7.31` is not possible for both group replication and standalone. That means, it is possible to upgrade any version above `5.7.31`. Here, we are going to create a `MySQL` Group Replication using MySQL  `5.7.31`. Then we are going to upgrade this version to `8.0.21`.

**Deploy MySQL Group Replication:**

In this section, we are going to deploy a MySQL group replication with 3 members. Then, in the next section we will upgrade the version of the  members using upgrading. Below is the YAML of the `MySQL` cr that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: MySQL
metadata:
  name: my-group
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "5.7.33"
  replicas: 3
  topology:
    mode: GroupReplication
    group:
      name: "dc002fc3-c412-4d18-b1d4-66c1fbfbbc9b"
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

Let's create the `MySQL` cr we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/mysql/upgrading/majorversion/group_replication.yaml
mysql.kubedb.com/my-group created
```

**Wait for the cluster to be ready:**

`KubeDB` operator watches for `MySQL` objects using Kubernetes API. When a `MySQL` object is created, `KubeDB` operator will create a new StatefulSet, Services, and Secrets, etc. A secret called `my-group-auth` (format: <em>{mysql-object-name}-auth</em>) will be created storing the password for mysql superuser.
Now, watch `MySQL` is going to  `Running` state and also watch `StatefulSet` and its pod is created and going to `Running` state,

```bash
$ watch -n 3 kubectl get my -n demo my-group
Every 3.0s: kubectl get my -n demo my-group                      suaas-appscode: Thu Jun 18 14:30:24 2020

NAME       VERSION   STATUS    AGE
my-group   5.7.31    Running   5m52s

$ watch -n 3 kubectl get sts -n demo my-group
Every 3.0s: kubectl get sts -n demo my-group                     suaas-appscode: Thu Jun 18 14:31:44 2020

NAME       READY   AGE
my-group   3/3     7m12s

$ watch -n 3 kubectl get pod -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mysqls.kubedb.com,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-group
Every 3.0s: kubectl get pod -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mysqls.kubedb.com...  suaas-appscode: Thu Jun 18 14:35:35 2020

NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-group-0   2/2     Running   0          11m
my-group-1   2/2     Running   0          9m53s
my-group-2   2/2     Running   0          6m48s
```

Let's verify the `MySQL`, the `StatefulSet` and its `Pod` image version,

```bash
$ kubectl get my -n demo my-group -o=jsonpath='{.spec.version}{"\n"}'
5.7.31

$ kubectl get sts -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mysqls.kubedb.com,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-group -o json | jq '.items[].spec.template.spec.containers[1].image'
"kubedb/mysql:5.7.31"

$ kubectl get pod -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mysqls.kubedb.com,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-group -o json | jq '.items[].spec.containers[1].image'
"kubedb/mysql:5.7.31"
"kubedb/mysql:5.7.31"
"kubedb/mysql:5.7.31"
```

Let's also verify that the StatefulSet’s pods have joined into a group replication,

```bash
$ kubectl get secrets -n demo my-group-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\username}' | base64 -d
root

$ kubectl get secrets -n demo my-group-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -d
sWfUMoqRpOJyomgb

$ kubectl exec -it -n demo my-group-0 -c mysql -- mysql -u root --password=OUta0G6QnyBuKmi0 --host=my-group-0.my-group-gvr.demo -e "select * from performance_schema.replication_group_members"
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

+---------------------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+-------------+--------------+
```

We are ready to apply upgrading on this `MySQL` group replication.

#### Upgrade

Here, we are going to upgrade the `MySQL` group replication from `5.7.31` to `8.0.21`.

**Create MySQLOpsRequest:**

To upgrade your database cluster, you have to create a `MySQLOpsRequest` cr with your desired version that supported by `KubeDB`. Below is the YAML of the `MySQLOpsRequest` cr that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MySQLOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: my-upgrade-major-group
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: Upgrade
  databaseRef:
    name: my-group
  upgrade:
    targetVersion: "8.0.21"
```

Here,

- `spec.databaseRef.name` specifies that we are performing operation on `my-group` MySQL database.
- `spec.type` specifies that we are going to perform `Upgrade` on our database.
- `spec.upgrade.targetVersion` specifies expected version `8.0.21` after upgrading.

Let's create the `MySQLOpsRequest` cr we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/mysql/upgrading/majorversion/upgrade_major_version_group.yaml
mysqlopsrequest.ops.kubedb.com/my-upgrade-major-group created
```

> Note: During the upgradation of the major version of MySQL group replication, a new StatefulSet is created by the KubeDB enterprise operator and the old one is deleted. The name of the newly created StatefulSet is formed as follows: `<mysql-name>-<suffix>`.
Here, `<suffix>` is a positive integer number and starts with 1. It's determined as follows:
For one-time major version upgrading of group replication, the suffix will be 1.
For the 2nd time major version upgrading of group replication, the suffix will be 2.
It will be continued...

**Verify MySQL version upgraded successfully:**

If everything goes well, `KubeDB` enterprise operator will create a new `StatefulSet` named `my-group-1` with the desire updated version and delete the old one.

At first, we will wait for `MySQLOpsRequest` to be successful.  Run the following command to watch `MySQlOpsRequest` cr,

```bash
$ watch -n 3 kubectl get myops -n demo my-upgrade-major-group
Every 3.0s: kubectl get myops -n demo my-upgrade-major-group     suaas-appscode: Sat Jul 25 21:41:39 2020

NAME                     TYPE      STATUS       AGE
my-upgrade-major-group   Upgrade   Successful   5m26s
```

You can see from the above output that the `MySQLOpsRequest` has succeeded. If we describe the `MySQLOpsRequest`, we shall see that the `MySQL` group replication is updated with new images and the `StatefulSet` is created with a new image.

```bash
$ kubectl describe myops -n demo my-upgrade-major-group

```

Now, we are going to verify whether the `MySQL` and `StatefulSet` and it's `Pod` have updated with new image. Let's check,

```bash
$ kubectl get my -n demo my-group -o=jsonpath='{.spec.version}{"\n"}'
8.0.21

$ kubectl get sts -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mysqls.kubedb.com,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-group -o json | jq '.items[].spec.template.spec.containers[1].image'
"kubedb/mysql:8.0.21"

$ kubectl get pod -n demo -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mysqls.kubedb.com,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-group -o json | jq '.items[].spec.containers[1].image'
"kubedb/mysql:8.0.21"
"kubedb/mysql:8.0.21"
"kubedb/mysql:8.0.21"
```

Let's also check the StatefulSet pods have joined the `MySQL` group replication,

```bash
$ kubectl get secrets -n demo my-group-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\username}' | base64 -d
root

$ kubectl get secrets -n demo my-group-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -d
sWfUMoqRpOJyomgb

$ kubectl exec -it -n demo my-group-1-0 -c mysql -- mysql -u root --password=OUta0G6QnyBuKmi0 --host=my-group-1-0.my-group-gvr.demo -e "select * from performance_schema.replication_group_members"
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

+---------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+----------------+
```

You can see above that our `MySQL` group replication now has updated members. It verifies that we have successfully upgraded our cluster.
