# Updating Memcached version Overview

This guide will give you an overview on how KubeDB Ops Manager update the version of `Memcached` database.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [Memcached](/docs/guides/memcached/concepts/memcached.md)
  - [MemcachedOpsRequest](/docs/guides/memcached/concepts/memcached-opsrequest.md)

## How Update Version Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB Ops Manager used to update the version of `Memcached`. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The updating process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `Memcached` Custom Resource (CR).

2. `KubeDB` Community operator watches the `Memcached` CR.

3. When the operator finds a `Memcached` CR, it creates required number of `PetSets` and related necessary stuff like appbinding, services, etc.

4. Then, in order to update the version of the `Memcached` database the user creates a `MemcachedOpsRequest` CR with the desired version.

5. `KubeDB` Enterprise operator watches the `MemcachedOpsRequest` and `MemcachedSentinelOpsRequest` CR.

6. When it finds a `MemcachedOpsRequest` CR, it halts the `Memcached` object which is referred from the `MemcachedOpsRequest`. So, the `KubeDB` Community operator doesn't perform any operations on the `Memcached` object during the updating process.  

7. By looking at the target version from `MemcachedOpsRequest` CR, `KubeDB` Enterprise operator updates the images of all the `PetSets`.

8. After successfully updating the `PetSets` and their `Pods` images, the `KubeDB` Enterprise operator updates the image of the `Memcached` object to reflect the updated state of the database.

9. After successfully updating of `Memcached`object, the `KubeDB` Enterprise operator resumes the `Memcached` object so that the `KubeDB` Community operator can resume its usual operations.

In the next doc, we are going to show a step-by-step guide on updating of a Memcached database using update operation.
