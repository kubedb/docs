# AppBinding

## What is AppBinding

An `AppBinding` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition`(CRD) which points to an application using either its URL (usually for a non-Kubernetes resident service instance) or a Kubernetes service object (if self-hosted in a Kubernetes cluster), some optional parameters and a credential secret. To learn more about AppBinding and the problems it solves, please read this blog post: [The case for AppBinding](https://appscode.com/blog/post/the-case-for-appbinding).

If you deploy a database using [KubeDB](https://kubedb.com/docs/latest/welcome/), `AppBinding` object will be created automatically for it. Otherwise, you have to create an `AppBinding` object manually pointing to your desired database.

KubeDB uses [Stash](https://appscode.com/products/stash/) to perform backup/recovery of databases. Stash needs to know how to connect with a target database and the credentials necessary to access it. This is done via an `AppBinding`.

## AppBinding CRD Specification

Like any official Kubernetes resource, an `AppBinding` has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta` and `Spec` sections. However, unlike other Kubernetes resources, it does not have a `Status` section.

An `AppBinding` object created by `KubeDB` for PostgreSQL database is shown below,

```yaml
  apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
  kind: AppBinding
  metadata:
    annotations:
      kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
        {"apiVersion":"appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1","kind":"AppBinding","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"memcached-appbinding","namespace":"demo"},"spec":{"appRef":{"apiGroup":"kubedb.com","kind":"Memcached","name":"mc1","namespace":"demo"},"clientConfig":{"service":{"name":"memcached","namespace":"demo","port":11211,"scheme":"tcp"}},"secret":{"name":"memcached-auth"},"type":"kubedb.com/memcached","version":"1.6.22"}}
    creationTimestamp: "2024-08-26T09:51:57Z"
    generation: 1
    name: memcached-appbinding
    namespace: demo
    resourceVersion: "4172425"
    uid: 01a902e2-3de6-45de-85a3-4f115b334625
  spec:
    appRef:
      apiGroup: kubedb.com
      kind: Memcached
      name: mc1
      namespace: demo
    clientConfig:
      service:
        name: memcached
        namespace: demo
        port: 11211
        scheme: tcp
    secret:
      name: memcached-auth
    type: kubedb.com/memcached
    version: 1.6.22
```
Here, we are going to describe the sections of an `AppBinding` crd.

### AppBinding `Spec`

An `AppBinding` object has the following fields in the `spec` section:

#### spec.type

`spec.type` is an optional field that indicates the type of the app that this `AppBinding` is pointing to.

#### spec.secret

`spec.secret` specifies the name of the secret which contains the credentials that are required to access the database. This secret must be in the same namespace as the `AppBinding`.

This secret must contain the following keys:

| Key                 | Usage                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Username`     | Username of the target Memcached database.                    |
| `Password` | Password for the user specified by `Username`. |


#### spec.appRef
appRef refers to the underlying application. It has 4 fields named `apiGroup`, `kind`, `name` & `namespace`.


#### spec.clientConfig

`spec.clientConfig` defines how to communicate with the target database. You can use either an URL or a Kubernetes service to connect with the database. You don't have to specify both of them.

You can configure following fields in `spec.clientConfig` section:

- **spec.clientConfig.url**

  `spec.clientConfig.url` gives the location of the database, in standard URL form (i.e. `[scheme://]host:port/[path]`). This is particularly useful when the target database is running outside of the Kubernetes cluster. If your database is running inside the cluster, use `spec.clientConfig.service` section instead.

  > Note that, attempting to use a user or basic auth (e.g. `user:password@host:port`) is not allowed. Stash will insert them automatically from the respective secret. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not allowed either.

- **spec.clientConfig.service**

  If you are running the database inside the Kubernetes cluster, you can use Kubernetes service to connect with the database. You have to specify the following fields in `spec.clientConfig.service` section if you manually create an `AppBinding` object.

  - **name :** `name` indicates the name of the service that connects with the target database.
  - **scheme :** `scheme` specifies the scheme (i.e. http, https) to use to connect with the database.
  - **port :** `port` specifies the port where the target database is running.

- **spec.clientConfig.insecureSkipTLSVerify**

  `spec.clientConfig.insecureSkipTLSVerify` is used to disable TLS certificate verification while connecting with the database. We strongly discourage to disable TLS verification during backup. You should provide the respective CA bundle through `spec.clientConfig.caBundle` field instead.

- **spec.clientConfig.caBundle**

  `spec.clientConfig.caBundle` is a PEM encoded CA bundle which will be used to validate the serving certificate of the database.
