# MemcachedOpsRequest

## What is MemcachedOpsRequest

`MemcachedOpsRequest` is a Kubernetes `Custom Resource Definitions` (CRD). It provides declarative configuration for Memcached administrative operations like database version updating, horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, etc. in a Kubernetes native way.

## MemcachedOpsRequest CRD Specifications

Like any official Kubernetes resource, a `MemcachedOpsRequest` has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta`, `Spec` and `Status` sections.

Here, some sample `MemcachedOpsRequest` CRs for different administrative operations is given below.

Sample MemcachedOpsRequest for updating database version:

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MemcachedOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: update-memcd
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: UpdateVersion
  databaseRef:
    name: memcd-quickstart
  updateVersion:
    targetVersion: 1.6.22
```

Sample `MemcachedOpsRequest` for horizontal scaling:
```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MemcachedOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: memcd-horizontal-down
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: HorizontalScaling
  databaseRef:
    name: memcd-quickstart
  horizontalScaling:
    replicas: 2
```

Sample `MemcachedOpsRequest` for vertical scaling:

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MemcachedOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: memcd-vertical
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: VerticalScaling
  databaseRef:
    name: memcd-quickstart
  verticalScaling:
    memcached:
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "200Mi"
          cpu: "200m"
        limits:
          memory: "200Mi"
          cpu: "200m"
```

Sample `MemcachedOpsRequest` for reconfiguration:
```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MemcachedOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: memcd-reconfig
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: Reconfigure
  databaseRef:
    name: memcd-quickstart
  configuration:
    applyConfig:
      memcached.conf: |
        -m 50
        -c 50

```

## MemcachedOpsRequest Spec
A `MemcachedOpsRequest` object has the following fields in the `spec` section:
### spec.databaseRef
`spec.databaseRef` is a required field that point to the Memcached object where the administrative operations will be applied. This field consists of the following sub-field:
- **spec.databaseRef.name :** specifies the name of the Memcached object.

### spec.type
`spec.type` specifies the kind of operation that will be applied to the database. Currently, the following types of operations are allowed in `MemcachedOpsRequest`.

- UpdateVersion
- HorizontalScaling
- VerticalScaling
- Restart
- Reconfigure

### spec.updateVersion
If you want to update your Memcacheds version, you have to 
>You can only update between Memcached versions. KubeDB does not support downgrade for Memcached.

### spec.horizontalScaling
If you want to scale-up or scale-down your Memcached, you have to specify `spec.horizontalScaling` section. This field consists of the following sub-field:


- `spec.horizontalScaling.replicas` indicates the desired number of replicas for your Memcahced instance after scaling. For example, if your cluster currently has 4 replicas, and you want to add additional 2 replicas then you have to specify 6 in spec.horizontalScaling.replicas field. Similarly, if you want to remove one replicas, you have to specify 3 in spec.horizontalScaling.replicas field.

### spec.verticalScaling
`spec.verticalScaling` is a required field specifying the information of Memcached resources like cpu, memory that will be scaled. This field consists of the following sub-fields:

- `spec.verticalScaling.memcached` indicates the `Memcached` server resources. It has the below structure:
```yaml
requests:
  memory: "200Mi"
  cpu: "200m"
limits:
  memory: "200Mi"
  cpu: "200m"
```

Here, when you specify the resource request for `Memcached` container, the scheduler uses this information to decide which node to place the container of the Pod on and when you specify a resource limit for `Memcached` container, the kubelet enforces those limits so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource than the limit you set. You can found more details from [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

- `spec.verticalScaling.exporter` indicates the `exporter` container resources. It has the same structure as `spec.verticalScaling.memcached` and you can scale the resource the same way as `memcached` container.

>You can increase/decrease resources for both memcached  container and exporter container on a single MemcachedOpsRequest CR.

### spec.timeout
As we internally retry the ops request steps multiple times, this `timeout` field helps the users to specify the timeout for those steps of the ops request (in second). If a step doesnâ€™t finish within the specified timeout, the ops request will result in failure.

### spec.apply
This field controls the execution of opsRequest depending on the database state. It has two supported values: `Always` & `IfReady`. Use `IfReady`, if you want to process the opsRequest only when the database is Ready. And use `Always`, if you want to process the execution of opsReq irrespective of the Database state.

## MemcachedOpsRequest Status
After creating the Ops request status section is added in MemcachedOpsRequest CR. The yaml looks like following:

```yaml
  apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
  kind: MemcachedOpsRequest
  metadata:
    annotations:
      kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
        {"apiVersion":"ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1","kind":"MemcachedOpsRequest","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"memcached-mc","namespace":"demo"},"spec":{"databaseRef":{"name":"mc1"},"type":"VerticalScaling","verticalScaling":{"memcached":{"resources":{"limits":{"cpu":"200m","memory":"200Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"200m","memory":"200Mi"}}}}}}

```
`.status` describes the current state of the `MemcachedOpsRequest` operation. It has the following fields:

### status.phase
`status.phase` indicates the overall phase of the operation for this `MemcachedOpsRequest`. It can have the following three values:

| Phase      | Meaning                                                                          |
