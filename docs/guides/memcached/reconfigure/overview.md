# Reconfiguring Memcached

This guide will give an overview on how KubeDB Ops-manager operator reconfigures `Memcached` database.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [Memcached](/docs/guides/memcached/concepts/memcached.md)
  - [MemcachedOpsRequest](/docs/guides/memcached/concepts/memcached-opsrequest.md)

## How Reconfiguring Memcached Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB Ops-manager operator reconfigures `Memcached` database components. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The Reconfiguring Memcached process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `Memcached` Custom Resource (CR).

2. `KubeDB` operator watches the `Memcached` CR.

3. When the operator finds a `Memcached` CR, it creates required number of `PetSets` and related necessary stuff like secrets, services, etc.

4. Then, in order to reconfigure the `Memcached` database the user creates a `MemcachedOpsRequest` CR with desired information.

5. `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator watches the `MemcachedOpsRequest` CR.

6. When it finds a `MemcachedOpsRequest` CR, it halts the `Memcached` object which is referred from the `MemcachedOpsRequest`. So, the `KubeDB` Provisioner  operator doesn't perform any operations on the `Memcached` object during the reconfiguring process.  

7. Then the `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator will replace the existing configuration with the new configuration provided or merge the new configuration with the existing configuration according to the `MemcachedOpsRequest` CR.

8. Then the `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator will restart the related PetSet Pods so that they restart with the new configuration defined in the `MemcachedOpsRequest` CR.

9. After the successful reconfiguring of the `Memcached` components, the `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator resumes the `Memcached` object so that the `KubeDB` Provisioner  operator resumes its usual operations.

In the next docs, we are going to show a step by step guide on reconfiguring Memcached database components using `MemcachedOpsRequest` CRD.
