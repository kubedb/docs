# Solr QuickStart

This tutorial will show you how to use KubeDB to run a Solr database.

<p align="center">

</p>

## Before You Begin

At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

Now, install the KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/install/_index.md).  and make sure install with helm command including `--set global.featureGates.Solr=true --set global.featureGates.ZooKeeper=true` to ensure Solr and ZooKeeper crd.

To keep things isolated, this tutorial uses a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```bash
$ kubectl create namespace demo
namespace/demo created

$ kubectl get namespace
NAME                 STATUS   AGE
demo                 Active   9s
```

> Note: YAML files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/guides/solr/quickstart/overview/yamls](https://github.com/kubedb/docs/tree/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/solr/quickstart/overview/yamls) folder in GitHub repository [kubedb/docs](https://github.com/kubedb/docs).

> We have designed this tutorial to demonstrate a production setup of KubeDB managed Solr. If you just want to try out KubeDB, you can bypass some safety features following the tips [here](/docs/guides/solr/quickstart/overview/index.md#tips-for-testing).

## Find Available StorageClass

We will have to provide `StorageClass` in Solr CRD specification. Check available `StorageClass` in your cluster using the following command,

```bash
$ kubectl get storageclass
NAME                 PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
standard (default)   rancher.io/local-path   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  14h
```

Here, we have `standard` StorageClass in our cluster from [Local Path Provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner).

## Find Available SolrVersion

When you install the KubeDB operator, it registers a CRD named `SolrVersions`. The installation process comes with a set of tested SolrVersion objects. Let's check available SolrVersions by,

```bash
$ kubectl get solrversion
NAME     VERSION   DB_IMAGE                              DEPRECATED   AGE
8.11.2   8.11.2    ghcr.io/appscode-images/solr:8.11.2                9d
9.4.1    9.4.1     ghcr.io/appscode-images/solr:9.4.1                 9d
```

Notice the `DEPRECATED` column. Here, `true` means that this SolrVersion is deprecated for the current KubeDB version. KubeDB will not work for deprecated SolrVersion.

In this tutorial, we will use `9.4.1` SolrVersion CR to create a Solr cluster.

> Note: An image with a higher modification tag will have more features and fixes than an image with a lower modification tag. Hence, it is recommended to use SolrVersion CRD with the highest modification tag to take advantage of the latest features. For example, use `9.4.1` over `8.11.2`.

## Create a Solr Cluster

The KubeDB operator implements a Solr CRD to define the specification of a Solr database.

The KubeDB Solr runs in `solrcloud` mode. Hence, it needs a external zookeeper to distribute replicas among pods and save configurations.

We will use KubeDB ZooKeeper for this purpose.

The ZooKeeper instance used for this tutorial:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: ZooKeeper
metadata:
  name: zoo-com
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: 3.8.3
  replicas: 3
  deletionPolicy: Delete
  adminServerPort: 8080
  storage:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: "100Mi"
    storageClassName: standard
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
```

We have to apply zookeeper first and wait till atleast pods are running to make sure that a cluster has been formed.

Here,

- `spec.version` - is the name of the ZooKeeperVersion CR. Here, a ZooKeeper of version `3.8.3` will be created.
- `spec.replicas` - specifies the number of ZooKeeper nodes.
- `spec.storageType` - specifies the type of storage that will be used for ZooKeeper database. It can be `Durable` or `Ephemeral`. The default value of this field is `Durable`. If `Ephemeral` is used then KubeDB will create the ZooKeeper database using `EmptyDir` volume. In this case, you don't have to specify `spec.storage` field. This is useful for testing purposes.
- `spec.storage` specifies the StorageClass of PVC dynamically allocated to store data for this database. This storage spec will be passed to the Petsets created by the KubeDB operator to run database pods. You can specify any StorageClass available in your cluster with appropriate resource requests. If you don't specify `spec.storageType: Ephemeral`, then this field is required.
- `spec.deletionPolicy` specifies what KubeDB should do when a user try to delete ZooKeeper CR. Deletion policy `Delete` will delete the database pods, secret and PVC when the ZooKeeper CR is deleted. Checkout the [link](/docs/guides/zookeeper/concepts/zookeeper.md#specdeletionpolicy) for details.

> Note: `spec.storage` section is used to create PVC for database pod. It will create PVC with storage size specified in the `storage.resources.requests` field. Don't specify `limits` here. PVC does not get resized automatically.

Let's create the ZooKeeper CR that is shown above:

```bash
$ $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/solr/quickstart/overview/yamls/zookeeper/zookeeper.yaml
ZooKeeper.kubedb.com/es-quickstart created
```

The ZooKeeper's `STATUS` will go from `Provisioning` to `Ready` state within few minutes. Once the `STATUS` is `Ready`, you are ready to use the database.

```bash
$ kubectl get ZooKeeper -n demo -w
NAME       TYPE                  VERSION   STATUS   AGE
zoo-com    kubedb.com/v1alpha2   3.7.2     Ready    13m
```

Then we can deploy solr in our cluster.

The Solr instance used for this tutorial:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Solr
metadata:
  name: solr-combined
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: 9.4.1
  deletionPolicy: Delete
  replicas: 2
  zookeeperRef:
    name: zk-com
    namespace: demo
  storage:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 2Gi
    storageClassName: standard
```

Here,

- `spec.version` - is the name of the SolrVersion CR. Here, a Solr of version `9.4.1` will be created.
- `spec.replicas` - specifies the number of Solr nodes.
- `spec.storageType` - specifies the type of storage that will be used for Solr database. It can be `Durable` or `Ephemeral`. The default value of this field is `Durable`. If `Ephemeral` is used then KubeDB will create the Solr database using `EmptyDir` volume. In this case, you don't have to specify `spec.storage` field. This is useful for testing purposes.
- `spec.storage` specifies the StorageClass of PVC dynamically allocated to store data for this database. This storage spec will be passed to the Petset created by the KubeDB operator to run database pods. You can specify any StorageClass available in your cluster with appropriate resource requests. If you don't specify `spec.storageType: Ephemeral`, then this field is required.
- `spec.deletionPolicy` specifies what KubeDB should do when a user try to delete Solr CR. Deletion policy `Delete` will delete the database pods, secret and PVC when the Solr CR is deleted. Checkout the [link](/docs/guides/solr/concepts/solr.md#specdeletionpolicy) for details.

> Note: `spec.storage` section is used to create PVC for database pod. It will create PVC with storage size specified in the `storage.resources.requests` field. Don't specify `limits` here. PVC does not get resized automatically.

Let's create the Solr CR that is shown above:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/solr/quickstart/overview/yamls/solr/solr.yaml
solr.kubedb.com/solr-combined created
```

The Solr's `STATUS` will go from `Provisioning` to `Ready` state within few minutes. Once the `STATUS` is `Ready`, you are ready to use the database.

```bash
$ kubectl get Solr -n demo -w
NAME            TYPE                    VERSION     STATUS   AGE
solr-combined   kubedb.com/v1alpha2     9.4.1       Ready    17m
```

### KubeDB Operator Generated Resources

On deployment of a Solr CR, the operator creates the following resources:

```bash
$ kubectl get all,secret,pvc -n demo -l 'app.kubernetes.io/instance=solr-combined'
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

- `PetSet` - a PetSet(Appscode manages customized statefulset) named after the Solr instance. In topology mode, the operator creates 3 PetSets with name `{Solr-Name}-{Sufix}`.
- `Services` -  2 services are generated for each Solr database.
    - `{Solr-Name}` - the client service which is used to connect to the database. It points to the `overseer` nodes.
    - `{Solr-Name}-pods` - the node discovery service which is used by the Solr nodes to communicate each other. It is a headless service.
- `AppBinding` - an [AppBinding](/docs/guides/solr/concepts/appbinding.md) which hold to connect information for the database. It is also named after the solr instance.
- `Secrets` - 3 types of secrets are generated for each Solr database.
    - `{Solr-Name}-admin-cred` - the auth secrets which hold the `username` and `password` for the solr users. The auth secret `solr-combined-admin-cred` holds the `username` and `password` for `admin` user which lets administrative access.
    - `{Solr-Name}-config` - the default configuration secret created by the operator.
    - `{Solr-Name}-auth-config` - the configuration secret of admin user information created by the operator.
    - `{Solr-Name}-zk-digest` - the auth secret which contains the `username` and `password` for zookeeper digest secret which is able to access zookeeper data.
    - `{Solr-Name}-zk-digest-readonly` - the auth secret which contains the `username` and `password` for zookeeper readonly digest secret which is able to read zookeeper data.


## Connect with Solr Database

We will use [port forwarding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/) to connect with our Solr database. Then we will use `curl` to send `HTTP` requests to check cluster health to verify that our Solr database is working well.

Let's port-forward the port `8983` to local machine:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward -n demo svc/solr-combined 8983
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8983 -> 8983
Forwarding from [::1]:8983 -> 8983
```

Now, our Solr cluster is accessible at `localhost:8983`.

**Connection information:**

- Address: `localhost:8983`
- Username:

  ```bash
  $ kubectl get secret -n demo solr-combined-admin-cred -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d
  admin
    ```

- Password:

  ```bash
  $ kubectl get secret -n demo solr-combined-admin-cred -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
  Xy3ZjyU)~(9IO8_n
  ```

Now let's check the health of our Solr database.

```bash
$ curl -XGET -k -u 'admin:Xy3ZjyU)~(9IO8_n' "http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CLUSTERSTATUS"
{
  "responseHeader":{
    "status":0,
    "QTime":1
  },
  "cluster":{
    "collections":{
      "kubedb-collection":{
        "pullReplicas":"0",
        "configName":"kubedb-collection.AUTOCREATED",
        "replicationFactor":1,
        "router":{
          "name":"compositeId"
        },
        "nrtReplicas":1,
        "tlogReplicas":"0",
        "shards":{
          "shard1":{
            "range":"80000000-7fffffff",
            "state":"active",
            "replicas":{
              "core_node2":{
                "core":"kubedb-collection_shard1_replica_n1",
                "node_name":"solr-combined-2.solr-combined-pods.demo:8983_solr",
                "type":"NRT",
                "state":"active",
                "leader":"true",
                "force_set_state":"false",
                "base_url":"http://solr-combined-2.solr-combined-pods.demo:8983/solr"
              }
            },
            "health":"GREEN"
          }
        },
        "health":"GREEN",
        "znodeVersion":4
      }
    },
    "live_nodes":["solr-combined-2.solr-combined-pods.demo:8983_solr","solr-combined-1.solr-combined-pods.demo:8983_solr","solr-combined-0.solr-combined-pods.demo:8983_solr"]
  }
}
```

From the health information above, we can see that health of our collections in Solr cluster's status is `green` which means the cluster is healthy.

## Halt Solr

KubeDB takes advantage of `ValidationWebhook` feature in Kubernetes 1.9.0 or later clusters to implement `DoNotTerminate` deletion policy. If admission webhook is enabled, it prevents the user from deleting the database as long as the `spec.deletionPolicy` is set `DoNotTerminate`.

To halt the database, we have to set `spec.deletionPolicy:` to `Halt` by updating it,

```bash
$ kubectl patch -n demo solr solr-combined -p '{"spec":{"deletionPolicy":"Halt"}}' --type="merge"
solr.kubedb.com/solr-combined patched
```

Now, if you delete the Solr object, the KubeDB operator will delete every resource created for this Solr CR, but leaves the auth secrets, and PVCs.

```bash
$  kubectl delete solr -n demo solr-combined
solr.kubedb.com "solr-combined" deleted

## Resume Solr

Say, the Solr CR was deleted with `spec.deletionPolicy` to `Halt` and you want to re-create the Solr cluster using the existing auth secrets and the PVCs.

You can do it by simpily re-deploying the original Solr object:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/guides/solr/quickstart/overview/yamls/solr/solr.yaml
solr.kubedb.com/solr-combined created
```

## Cleaning up

To cleanup the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```bash
$ kubectl patch -n demo solr solr-combined -p '{"spec":{"deletionPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"
solr.kubedb.com/solr-combined patched

$ kubectl delete -n demo sl/solr-combined
solr.kubedb.com "solr-combined" deleted

$  kubectl delete namespace demo
namespace "demo" deleted
```

## Tips for Testing

If you are just testing some basic functionalities, you might want to avoid additional hassles due to some safety features that are great for the production environment. You can follow these tips to avoid them.

1. **Use `storageType: Ephemeral`**. Databases are precious. You might not want to lose your data in your production environment if the database pod fails. So, we recommend to use `spec.storageType: Durable` and provide storage spec in `spec.storage` section. For testing purposes, you can just use `spec.storageType: Ephemeral`. KubeDB will use [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) for storage. You will not require to provide `spec.storage` section.
2. **Use `deletionPolicy: WipeOut`**. It is nice to be able to resume the database from the previous one. So, we preserve all your `PVCs` and auth `Secrets`. If you don't want to resume the database, you can just use `spec.deletionPolicy: WipeOut`. It will clean up every resouce that was created with the Solr CR. Checkout the [link](/docs/guides/solr/concepts/solr.md#specdeletionpolicy) for details.
