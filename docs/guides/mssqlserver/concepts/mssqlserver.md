# MSSQLServer

## What is MSSQLServer

`MSSQLServer` is a Kubernetes `Custom Resource Definitions` (CRD). It provides declarative configuration for [Microsoft SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/) in a Kubernetes native way. You only need to describe the desired database configuration in a MSSQLServer object, and the KubeDB operator will create Kubernetes objects in the desired state for you.

## MSSQLServer Spec

As with all other Kubernetes objects, a MSSQLServer needs `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields. It also needs a `.spec` section.

Below is an example `MSSQLServer` object.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: MSSQLServer
metadata:
  name: mssqlserver
  namespace: demo
spec:

### spec.version

`spec.version` is a required field that specifies the name of the [MSSQLServerVersion](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/concepts/catalog.md) crd where the docker images are specified. Currently, when you install KubeDB, it creates the following `MSSQLServerVersion` resources,

```bash
$ kubectl get msversion
NAME        VERSION   DB_IMAGE                                                DEPRECATED   AGE
2022-cu12   2022      mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-CU12-ubuntu-22.04                2d
2022-cu14   2022      mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-CU14-ubuntu-22.04                2d
```
### spec.replicas

`spec.replicas` specifies the total number of primary and secondary nodes in SQL Server Availability Group cluster configuration. One pod is selected as Primary and others act as secondary replicas. KubeDB uses `PodDisruptionBudget` to ensure that majority of the replicas are available during [voluntary disruptions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/#voluntary-and-involuntary-disruptions).

To learn more about how to setup a SQL Server Availability Group cluster (HA configuration) in KubeDB, please visit [here](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/clustering/ag_cluster.md).

### spec.leaderElection

There are three fields under MSSQLServer CRD's `spec.leaderElection`. These values define how fast the leader election can happen.

- `leaseDurationSeconds`: This is the duration in seconds that non-leader candidates will wait to force acquire leadership. This is measured against time of last observed ack. Default 15 sec.
- `renewDeadlineSeconds`: This is the duration in seconds that the acting master will retry refreshing leadership before giving up. Normally, LeaseDuration \* 2 / 3. Default 10 sec.
- `retryPeriodSeconds`: This is the duration in seconds the LeaderElector clients should wait between tries of actions. Normally, LeaseDuration / 3. Default 2 sec.

If the Cluster machine is powerful, user can reduce the times. But, Do not make it so little, in that case MSSQLServer will restart very often.


### spec.authSecret

`spec.authSecret` is an optional field that points to a Secret used to hold credentials for `mssqlserver` database. If not set, KubeDB operator creates a new Secret with name `{mssqlserver-name}-auth` that hold _username_ and _password_ for `mssqlserver` database.

If you want to use an existing or custom secret, please specify that when creating the MSSQLServer object using `spec.authSecret.name`. This Secret should contain superuser _username_ as `username` key and superuser _password_ as `password` key. Secrets provided by users are not managed by KubeDB, and therefore, won't be modified or garbage collected by the KubeDB operator.

Example:

```bash
$ kubectl create secret generic mssqlserver-auth -n demo \
             --from-literal=username='sa' \
             --from-literal=password='Pa55w0rd!'
secret/mssqlserver-auth created
```

```bash
$ kubectl get secret -n demo  mssqlserver-auth -oyaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: UGE1NXcwcmQh
  username: c2E=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2024-10-10T06:47:06Z"
  name: mssqlserver-auth
  namespace: demo
  resourceVersion: "315403"
  uid: dafcce02-b6a2-4e65-bdd1-db6b9b6d4913
type: Opaque
```

### spec.storageType

`spec.storageType` is an optional field that specifies the type of storage to use for database. It can be either `Durable` or `Ephemeral`. The default value of this field is `Durable`. If `Ephemeral` is used then KubeDB will create MSSQLServer database using [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) volume. In this case, you don't have to specify `spec.storage` field.

### spec.storage

If you don't set `spec.storageType:` to `Ephemeral` then `spec.storage` field is required. This field specifies the StorageClass of PVCs dynamically allocated to store data for the database. This storage spec will be passed to the PetSet created by KubeDB operator to run database pods. You can specify any StorageClass available in your cluster with appropriate resource requests.

- `spec.storage.storageClassName` is the name of the StorageClass used to provision PVCs. PVCs donâ€™t necessarily have to request a class. A PVC with its storageClassName set equal to "" is always interpreted to be requesting a PV with no class, so it can only be bound to PVs with no class (no annotation or one set equal to ""). A PVC with no storageClassName is not quite the same and is treated differently by the cluster depending on whether the DefaultStorageClass admission plugin is turned on.
- `spec.storage.accessModes` uses the same conventions as Kubernetes PVCs when requesting storage with specific access modes.
- `spec.storage.resources` can be used to request specific quantities of storage. This follows the same resource model used by PVCs.

To learn how to configure `spec.storage`, please visit the links below:

- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims

### spec.init

`spec.init` is an optional section that can be used to initialize a newly created MSSQLServer database. MSSQLServer databases can be initialized from these two ways:

1. Initialize from Script
2. Initialize from Snapshot

### spec.monitor

MSSQLServer managed by KubeDB can be monitored with builtin-Prometheus and Prometheus operator out-of-the-box. To learn more,

- [Monitor MSSQLServer with builtin Prometheus](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/monitoring/using-builtin-prometheus.md)
- [Monitor MSSQLServer with Prometheus operator](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/monitoring/using-prometheus-operator.md)

### spec.configSecret

`spec.configSecret` is an optional field that allows users to provide custom configuration for MSSQLServer. This field accepts a [`VolumeSource`](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.11/core/v1/types.go#L47). You can use any Kubernetes supported volume source such as `configMap`, `secret`, `azureDisk` etc. To learn more about how to use a custom configuration file see [here](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/configuration/using-config-file.md).

### spec.podTemplate

KubeDB allows providing a template for database pod through `spec.podTemplate`. KubeDB operator will pass the information provided in `spec.podTemplate` to the PetSet created for MSSQLServer.

KubeDB accept following fields to set in `spec.podTemplate:`

- metadata
  - annotations (pod's annotation)
- controller
  - annotations (petset's annotation)
- spec:
  - containers
  - volumes
  - podPlacementPolicy
  - serviceAccountName
  - initContainers
  - imagePullSecrets
  - nodeSelector
  - affinity
  - schedulerName
  - tolerations
  - priorityClassName
  - priority
  - securityContext
  - livenessProbe
  - readinessProbe
  - lifecycle

You can check out the full list [here](https://github.com/kmodules/offshoot-api/blob/master/api/v2/types.go#L26C1-L279C1).
Uses of some field of `spec.podTemplate` is described below,

#### spec.podTemplate.spec.tolerations

The `spec.podTemplate.spec.tolerations` is an optional field. This can be used to specify the pod's tolerations.

#### spec.podTemplate.spec.volumes

The `spec.podTemplate.spec.volumes` is an optional field. This can be used to provide the list of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod.

#### spec.podTemplate.spec.podPlacementPolicy

`spec.podTemplate.spec.podPlacementPolicy` is an optional field. This can be used to provide the reference of the podPlacementPolicy. This will be used by our Petset controller to place the db pods throughout the region, zone & nodes according to the policy. It utilizes kubernetes affinity & podTopologySpreadContraints feature to do so.


#### spec.podTemplate.spec.containers

The `spec.podTemplate.spec.containers` can be used to provide the list of containers and their configurations for to the database pod. some of the fields are described below,

##### spec.podTemplate.spec.containers[].name
The `spec.podTemplate.spec.containers[].name` field used to specify the name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated.

##### spec.podTemplate.spec.containers[].args
`spec.podTemplate.spec.containers[].args` is an optional field. This can be used to provide additional arguments to database installation.

##### spec.podTemplate.spec.containers[].env

`spec.podTemplate.spec.containers[].env` is an optional field that specifies the environment variables to pass to the MSSQLServer docker image. To know about supported environment variables, please visit [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server).

Note that, the KubeDB operator does not allow `MSSQL_SA_USERNAME` and `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` environment variable to set in `spec.podTemplate.spec.env`. If you want to set the superuser _username_ and _password_, please use `spec.authSecret` instead described earlier.

If you try to set `MSSQL_SA_USERNAME` or `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` environment variable in MSSQLServer CR, KubeDB operator will reject the request with following error,

```ini
The MSSQLServer "mssqlserver" is invalid: spec.podTemplate: Invalid value: "mssqlserver": environment variable MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD is forbidden to use in MSSQLServer spec
```

Also, note that KubeDB does not allow to update the environment variables as updating them does not have any effect once the database is created.

##### spec.podTemplate.spec.containers[].resources

`spec.podTemplate.spec.containers[].resources` is an optional field. This can be used to request compute resources required by containers of the database pods. To learn more, visit [here](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/).

#### spec.podTemplate.spec.serviceAccountName

`serviceAccountName` is an optional field supported by KubeDB Operator that can be used to specify a custom service account to fine tune role based access control.

If this field is left empty, the KubeDB operator will create a service account name matching MSSQLServer CR name. Role and RoleBinding that provide necessary access permissions will also be generated automatically for this service account.

If a service account name is given, but there's no existing service account by that name, the KubeDB operator will create one, and Role and RoleBinding that provide necessary access permissions will also be generated for this service account.

If a service account name is given, and there's an existing service account by that name, the KubeDB operator will use that existing service account. Since this service account is not managed by KubeDB, users are responsible for providing necessary access permissions manually. Follow the guide [here](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/custom-rbac/using-custom-rbac.md) to grant necessary permissions in this scenario.


#### spec.podTemplate.spec.nodeSelector

`spec.podTemplate.spec.nodeSelector` is an optional field that specifies a map of key-value pairs. For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the node must have each of the indicated key-value pairs as labels (it can have additional labels as well). To learn more, see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) .

### spec.serviceTemplate

KubeDB creates two different services for each MSSQLServer instance. One of them is a primary service named `<mssqlserver-name>` and points to the MSSQLServer `Primary` pod/node. Another one is a secondary service named `<mssqlserver-name>-secondary` and points to MSSQLServer `secondary` replica pods/nodes.

These `primary` and `secondary` services can be customized using [spec.serviceTemplate](#spec.servicetemplate).

You can provide template for the services using `spec.serviceTemplate`. This will allow you to set the type and other properties of the service. If `spec.serviceTemplate` is not provided, KubeDB will create a `primary` service of type `ClusterIP` with minimal settings.

KubeDB allows following fields to set in `spec.serviceTemplates`:
- `alias` represents the identifier of the service. It has the following possible value:
  - `primary` is used for the primary service identification.
  - `secondary` is used for the secondary service identification.
  - `stats` is used for the exporter service identification.
- metadata:
  - labels
  - annotations
- spec:
  - type
  - ports
  - clusterIP
  - externalIPs
  - loadBalancerIP
  - loadBalancerSourceRanges
  - externalTrafficPolicy
  - healthCheckNodePort
  - sessionAffinityConfig

See [here](https://github.com/kmodules/offshoot-api/blob/kubernetes-1.21.1/api/v1/types.go#L237) to understand these fields in detail.

## spec.healthChecker
It defines the attributes for the health checker.
- `spec.healthChecker.periodSeconds` specifies how often to perform the health check.
- `spec.healthChecker.timeoutSeconds` specifies the number of seconds after which the probe times out.
- `spec.healthChecker.failureThreshold` specifies minimum consecutive failures for the healthChecker to be considered failed.
- `spec.healthChecker.disableWriteCheck` specifies whether to disable the writeCheck or not.

Know details about KubeDB Health checking from this [blog post](https://appscode.com/blog/post/kubedb-health-checker/).


### spec.deletionPolicy

`deletionPolicy` gives flexibility whether to `nullify`(reject) the delete operation of `MSSQLServer` crd or which resources KubeDB should keep or delete when you delete `MSSQLServer` crd. KubeDB provides following four termination policies:

- DoNotTerminate
- Halt
- Delete (`Default`)
- WipeOut

When `deletionPolicy` is `DoNotTerminate`, KubeDB takes advantage of `ValidationWebhook` feature in Kubernetes 1.9.0 or later clusters to implement `DoNotTerminate` feature. If admission webhook is enabled, `DoNotTerminate` prevents users from deleting the database as long as the `spec.deletionPolicy` is set to `DoNotTerminate`.

Following table show what KubeDB does when you delete MSSQLServer crd for different termination policies,

| Behavior                            | DoNotTerminate |  Halt   |  Delete  | WipeOut  |
|-------------------------------------| :------------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| 1. Block Delete operation           |    &#10003;    | &#10007; | &#10007; | &#10007; |
| 2. Delete PetSet                    |    &#10007;    | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; |
| 3. Delete Services                  |    &#10007;    | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; |
| 4. Delete PVCs                      |    &#10007;    | &#10007; | &#10003; | &#10003; |
| 5. Delete Secrets                   |    &#10007;    | &#10007; | &#10007; | &#10003; |
| 6. Delete Snapshots                 |    &#10007;    | &#10007; | &#10007; | &#10003; |
| 7. Delete Snapshot data from bucket |    &#10007;    | &#10007; | &#10007; | &#10003; |

If you don't specify `spec.deletionPolicy` KubeDB uses `Delete` termination policy by default.

### spec.halted
Indicates that the database is halted and all offshoot Kubernetes resources except PVCs are deleted.

### Configuring Environment Variables for SQL Server on Linux
When deploying `Microsoft SQL Server` on Linux using containers, you need to specify the `product edition` through the [MSSQL_PID](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/mssql/server/about#configuration:~:text=MSSQL_PID%20is%20the,documentation%20here.) environment variable. This variable determines which SQL Server edition will run inside the container. The acceptable values for MSSQL_PID are:
Developer: This will run the container using the Developer Edition (this is the default if no MSSQL_PID environment variable is supplied)
Express: This will run the container using the Express Edition
Standard: This will run the container using the Standard Edition
Enterprise: This will run the container using the Enterprise Edition
EnterpriseCore: This will run the container using the Enterprise Edition Core
<valid product id>: This will run the container with the edition that is associated with the PID

For a complete list of environment variables that can be used, refer to the documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-configure-environment-variables?view=sql-server-2017).

Below is an example of how to configure the `MSSQL_PID` environment variable in the KubeDB MSSQLServer Custom Resource Definition (CRD):
```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: MSSQLServer
metadata:
  name: mssqlserver
  namespace: demo
spec:
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mssql
          env:
          - name: MSSQL_PID
            value: Enterprise
```
In this example, the SQL Server container will run the Enterprise Edition.
