# Microsoft SQL Server QuickStart

This tutorial will show you how to use KubeDB to run a Microsoft SQL Server database.

> Note: The yaml files used in this tutorial are stored in [docs/examples/mssqlserver/quickstart/](https://github.com/kubedb/docs/tree/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/mssqlserver/quickstart) folder in GitHub repository [kubedb/docs](https://github.com/kubedb/docs).

## Before You Begin

- At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- Now, install KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md)  and make sure install with helm command including `--set global.featureGates.MSSQLServer=true` to ensure MSSQLServer crd installation.

- [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) is required to run KubeDB. Check the available StorageClass in cluster.

  ```bash
  $ kubectl get storageclasses
  NAME                 PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
  standard (default)   rancher.io/local-path   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  5d20h
  ```

- To keep things isolated, this tutorial uses a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

  ```bash
  $ kubectl create ns demo
  namespace/demo created
  ```

## Find Available Microsoft SQL Server Versions

When you have installed KubeDB, it has created `MSSQLServerVersion` crd for all supported Microsoft SQL Server versions. Check it by using the `kubectl get mssqlserverversions`. You can also use `msversion` shorthand instead of `mssqlserverversions`.

```bash
$ kubectl get mssqlserverversions
NAME        VERSION   DB_IMAGE                                                DEPRECATED   AGE
2022-cu12   2022      mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-CU12-ubuntu-22.04                2d3h

```

## Create Microsoft SQL Server database

KubeDB implements a `MSSQLServer` CRD to define the specification of a Microsoft SQL Server database. Below is the `MSSQLServer` object created in this tutorial.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: MSSQLServer
metadata:
  name: mssqlserver-quickstart
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "2022-cu12"
  replicas: 1
  storageType: Durable
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      name: mssqlserver-issuer
      kind: Issuer
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
    clientTLS: false
  storage:
    storageClassName: "standard"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
  deletionPolicy: WipeOut
```

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/mssqlserver/quickstart/mssqlserver-quickstart.yaml
mssqlserver.kubedb.com/mssqlserver-quickstart created
```

Here,

- `spec.version` is the name of the MSSQLServerVersion CR where the docker images are specified. In this tutorial, a MSSQLServer `2022-cu12` database is going to be created.
- `spec.storageType` specifies the type of storage that will be used for MSSQLServer database. It can be `Durable` or `Ephemeral`. Default value of this field is `Durable`. If `Ephemeral` is used then KubeDB will create MSSQLServer database using `EmptyDir` volume. In this case, you don't have to specify `spec.storage` field. This is useful for testing purposes.
- `spec.tls` specifies the TLS/SSL configurations. The KubeDB operator supports TLS management by using the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/). Here `tls.clientTLS: false` means tls will not be enabled for SQL Server but the Issuer will be used to configure tls enabled wal-g proxy-server which is required for SQL Server backup operation.
- `spec.storage` specifies the StorageClass of PVC dynamically allocated to store data for this database. This storage spec will be passed to the PetSet created by KubeDB operator to run database pods. You can specify any StorageClass available in your cluster with appropriate resource requests.
- `spec.deletionPolicy` gives flexibility whether to `nullify`(reject) the delete operation of `MSSQLServer` CR or which resources KubeDB should keep or delete when you delete `MSSQLServer` CR. If admission webhook is enabled, It prevents users from deleting the database as long as the `spec.deletionPolicy` is set to `DoNotTerminate`. Learn details of all `DeletionPolicy` [here](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/database/index.md#specdeletionpolicy)

> Note: `spec.storage` section is used to create PVC for database pod. It will create PVC with storage size specified in storage.resources.requests field. Don't specify limits here. PVC does not get resized automatically.

KubeDB operator watches for `MSSQLServer` objects using Kubernetes api. When a `MSSQLServer` object is created, KubeDB operator will create a new PetSet and a Service with the matching MSSQLServer object name. KubeDB operator will also create a governing service for PetSets with the name `<MSSQLServerName>-pods`, if one is not already present.

```bash
$ kubectl get petset -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart
NAME                     AGE
mssqlserver-quickstart   13m


$ kubectl get pvc -n demo

data-mssqlserver-quickstart-0   Bound    pvc-ccbba9d2-5556-49cd-9ce8-23c28ad56f12   1Gi        RWO            standard       15m


$ kubectl get pv -n demo

pvc-ccbba9d2-5556-49cd-9ce8-23c28ad56f12   1Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    demo/data-mssqlserver-quickstart-0   standard                15m


kubectl get service -n demo
NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
mssqlserver-quickstart        ClusterIP   10.96.128.61   <none>        1433/TCP   15m
mssqlserver-quickstart-pods   ClusterIP   None           <none>        1433/TCP   15m

```

KubeDB operator sets the `status.phase` to `Ready` once the database is successfully created and is able to accept client connections. Run the following command to see the modified MSSQLServer object:

```bash
$ kubectl get ms -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart -o yaml

## Connect with MSSQLServer database

KubeDB operator has created a new Secret called `mssqlserver-quickstart-auth` *(format: {mssqlserver-object-name}-auth)* for storing the sa password for `mssqlserver`. This secret contains a `username` key which contains the *username* for MSSQLServer SA and a `password` key which contains the *password* for MSSQLServer SA user.

If you want to use an existing secret please specify that when creating the MSSQLServer object using `spec.authSecret.name`. While creating this secret manually, make sure the secret contains these two keys containing data `username` and `password` and also make sure of using `sa` as value of `username` and a strong password for the sa user. For more details see [here](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/database/index.md#specdatabasesecret).

Now, we need `username` and `password` to connect to this database from `kubectl exec` command. In this example  `mssqlserver-quickstart-auth` secret holds username and password

```bash
$ kubectl get secret -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\username}' | base64 -d
sa

$ kubectl get secret -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart-auth -o jsonpath='{.data.\password}' | base64 -d
axgXHj4oRIVQ1ocK
```
We can exec into the pod `mysql-quickstart-0` using the following command:
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart-0 -- bash
Defaulted container "mssql" out of: mssql, mssql-init (init)
mssql@mssqlserver-quickstart-0:/$
```

We can connect to the database using *sqlcmd* utility, the ODBC-based sqlcmd, available with SQL Server or the Microsoft Command Line Utilities, and part of the mssql-tools package on Linux.
To determine the version you have installed, run the following statement at the command line:
```bash
mssql@mssqlserver-quickstart-0:/$ /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd "-?"

## Database DeletionPolicy

This field is used to regulate the deletion process of the related resources when `MSSQLServer` object is deleted. User can set the value of this field according to their needs. The available options and their use case scenario is described below:

**DoNotTerminate:**

When `deletionPolicy` is set to `DoNotTerminate`, KubeDB takes advantage of `ValidationWebhook` feature in Kubernetes 1.9.0 or later clusters to implement `DoNotTerminate` feature. If admission webhook is enabled, It prevents users from deleting the database as long as the `spec.deletionPolicy` is set to `DoNotTerminate`. You can see this below:

```bash
$ kubectl delete ms -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart
The MSSQLServer "mssqlserver-quickstart" is invalid: spec.deletionPolicy: Invalid value: "mssqlserver-quickstart": Can not delete as deletionPolicy is set to "DoNotTerminate"
```

Now, run `kubectl patch -n demo ms mssqlserver-quickstart -p '{"spec":{"deletionPolicy":"Halt"}}' --type="merge"` to set `spec.deletionPolicy` to `Halt` (which deletes the mssqlserver object and keeps PVC, snapshots, Secrets intact) or remove this field (which default to `Delete`). Then you will be able to delete/halt the database.

Learn details of all `DeletionPolicy` [here](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/database/index.md#specdeletionpolicy).

**Halt:**

Suppose you want to reuse your database volume and credential to deploy your database in future using the same configurations. But, right now you just want to delete the database except the database volumes and credentials. In this scenario, you must set the `MSSQLServer` object `deletionPolicy` to `Halt`.

When the [DeletionPolicy](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/database/index.md#specdeletionpolicy) is set to `halt` and the MSSQLServer object is deleted, the KubeDB operator will delete the PetSet and its pods but leaves the `PVCs`, `secrets` and database backup data(`snapshots`) intact. You can set the `deletionPolicy` to `halt` in existing database using `patch` command for testing.

At first, run `kubectl patch -n demo ms mssqlserver-quickstart -p '{"spec":{"deletionPolicy":"Halt"}}' --type="merge"`. Then delete the mssqlserver object,

```bash
$ kubectl delete ms -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart
mssqlserver.kubedb.com "mssqlserver-quickstart" deleted
```

Now, run the following command to get mssqlserver resources in `demo` namespaces,

```bash
$ kubectl get petset,svc,secret,pvc -n demo 
NAME                                 TYPE                       DATA   AGE
secret/mssqlserver-quickstart-auth   kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      56m

NAME                                                  STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
persistentvolumeclaim/data-mssqlserver-quickstart-0   Bound    pvc-0e6a361e-9195-4d6b-8042-e90ec98d8288   1Gi        RWO            standard       4m17s

```

From the above output, you can see that all mssqlserver resources(`PetSet`, `Service`, etc.) are deleted except `PVC` and `Secret`. You can recreate your mssqlserver again using these resources.

>You can also set the `deletionPolicy` to `Halt`(deprecated). It's behavior same as `halt` and right now `halt` is replaced by `Halt`.

**Delete:**

If you want to delete the existing database along with the volumes used, but want to restore the database from previously taken `snapshots` and `secrets` then you might want to set the `MSSQLServer` object `deletionPolicy` to `Delete`. In this setting, `PetSet` and the volumes will be deleted. If you decide to restore the database, you can do so using the snapshots and the credentials.

When the [DeletionPolicy](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/database/index.md#specdeletionpolicy) is set to `Delete` and the MSSQLServer object is deleted, the KubeDB operator will delete the PetSet and its pods along with PVCs but leaves the `secret` and database backup data(`snapshots`) intact.

Suppose, we have a database with `deletionPolicy` set to `Delete`. Now, are going to delete the database using the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl delete ms -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart 
mssqlserver.kubedb.com "mssqlserver-quickstart" deleted
```

Now, run the following command to get all mssql resources in `demo` namespaces,

```bash
$ kubectl get petset,svc,secret,pvc -n demo
NAME                                 TYPE                       DATA   AGE
secret/mssqlserver-quickstart-auth   kubernetes.io/basic-auth   2      58m

```

From the above output, you can see that all mssqlserver resources(`PetSet`, `Service`, `PVCs` etc.) are deleted except `Secret`. You can initialize your mssqlserver using `snapshots`(if previously taken) and `secret`.

>If you don't set the deletionPolicy then the kubeDB set the DeletionPolicy to Delete by-default.

**WipeOut:**

You can totally delete the `MSSQLServer` database and relevant resources without any tracking by setting `deletionPolicy` to `WipeOut`. KubeDB operator will delete all relevant resources of this `MSSQLServer` database (i.e, `PVCs`, `Secrets`, `Snapshots`) when the `deletionPolicy` is set to `WipeOut`.

Suppose, we have a database with `deletionPolicy` set to `WipeOut`. Now, are going to delete the database using the following command:

```yaml
$ kubectl delete ms -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart
mssqlserver.kubedb.com "mssqlserver-quickstart" deleted
```

Now, run the following command to get all mssqlserver resources in `demo` namespaces,

```bash
$ kubectl get petset,svc,secret,pvc -n demo
No resources found in demo namespace.
```

From the above output, you can see that all mssqlserver resources are deleted. there is no option to recreate/reinitialize your database if `deletionPolicy` is set to `WipeOut`.

>Be careful when you set the `deletionPolicy` to `WipeOut`. Because there is no option to trace the database resources if once deleted the database.

## Cleaning up

To clean up the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```bash
kubectl patch -n demo mssqlserver/mssqlserver-quickstart -p '{"spec":{"deletionPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"
kubectl delete mssqlserver -n demo mssqlserver-quickstart 


kubectl delete ns demo
```

## Tips for Testing

If you are just testing some basic functionalities, you might want to avoid additional hassles due to some safety features that are great for production environment. You can follow these tips to avoid them.

1. **Use `storageType: Ephemeral`**. Databases are precious. You might not want to lose your data in your production environment if database pod fail. So, we recommend to use `spec.storageType: Durable` and provide storage spec in `spec.storage` section. For testing purpose, you can just use `spec.storageType: Ephemeral`. KubeDB will use [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) for storage. You will not require to provide `spec.storage` section.
2. **Use `deletionPolicy: WipeOut`**. It is nice to be able to delete everything created by KubeDB for a particular MSSQLServer crd when you delete the crd. For more details about deletion policy, please visit [here](/docs/guides/mysql/concepts/database/index.md#specdeletionpolicy).
