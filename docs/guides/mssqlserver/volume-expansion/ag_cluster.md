# MSSQLServer Volume Expansion

This guide will show you how to use `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator to expand the volume of a SQL Server Availability Group Cluster.

## Before You Begin

- You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md). Make sure install with helm command including `--set global.featureGates.MSSQLServer=true` to ensure MSSQLServer CRD installation.

- To configure TLS/SSL in `MSSQLServer`, `KubeDB` uses `cert-manager` to issue certificates. So first you have to make sure that the cluster has `cert-manager` installed. To install `cert-manager` in your cluster following steps [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/).

- You must have a `StorageClass` that supports volume expansion.

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MSSQLServer](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/concepts/mssqlserver.md)
  - [MSSQLServerOpsRequest](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/concepts/opsrequest.md)
  - [Volume Expansion Overview](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/volume-expansion/overview.md)

To keep everything isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

## Expand Volume of MSSQLServer Availability Group Cluster

Here, we are going to deploy a  `MSSQLServer` cluster using a supported version by `KubeDB` operator. Then we are going to apply `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` to expand its volume. The process of expanding MSSQLServer `standalone` is same as MSSQLServer Availability Group cluster.

### Prepare MSSQLServer Availability Group Cluster

At first verify that your cluster has a storage class, that supports volume expansion. Let's check,

```bash
$ kubectl get storageclass
NAME                   PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
local-path (default)   rancher.io/local-path   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  2d
longhorn (default)     driver.longhorn.io      Delete          Immediate              true                   3m25s
longhorn-static        driver.longhorn.io      Delete          Immediate              true                   3m19s
```

We can see from the output that `longhorn (default)` storage class has `ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION` field as true. So, this storage class supports volume expansion. We will use this storage class. 


Now, we are going to deploy a `MSSQLServer` in `AvailabilityGroup` Mode with version `2022-cu12`.

### Deploy MSSQLServer

First, an issuer needs to be created, even if TLS is not enabled for SQL Server. The issuer will be used to configure the TLS-enabled Wal-G proxy server, which is required for the SQL Server backup and restore operations.

### Create Issuer/ClusterIssuer

Now, we are going to create an example `Issuer` that will be used throughout the duration of this tutorial. Alternatively, you can follow this [cert-manager tutorial](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ca/) to create your own `Issuer`. By following the below steps, we are going to create our desired issuer,

- Start off by generating our ca-certificates using openssl,
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./ca.key -out ./ca.crt -subj "/CN=MSSQLServer/O=kubedb"
```
- Create a secret using the certificate files we have just generated,
```bash
$ kubectl create secret tls mssqlserver-ca --cert=ca.crt  --key=ca.key --namespace=demo 
secret/mssqlserver-ca created
```
Now, we are going to create an `Issuer` using the `mssqlserver-ca` secret that contains the ca-certificate we have just created. Below is the YAML of the `Issuer` CR that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
 name: mssqlserver-ca-issuer
 namespace: demo
spec:
 ca:
   secretName: mssqlserver-ca
```

Letâ€™s create the `Issuer` CR we have shown above,
```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/mssqlserver/ag-cluster/mssqlserver-ca-issuer.yaml
issuer.cert-manager.io/mssqlserver-ca-issuer created
```

In this section, we are going to deploy a MSSQLServer Cluster with 1GB volume. Then, in the next section we will expand its volume to 2GB using `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` CRD. Below is the YAML of the `MSSQLServer` CR that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: MSSQLServer
metadata:
  name: mssqlserver-ag-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "2022-cu12"
  replicas: 3
  topology:
    mode: AvailabilityGroup
    availabilityGroup:
      databases:
        - agdb1
        - agdb2
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      name: mssqlserver-ca-issuer
      kind: Issuer
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
    clientTLS: false
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mssql
          env:
            - name: ACCEPT_EULA
              value: "Y"
            - name: MSSQL_PID
              value: Evaluation # Change it 
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    storageClassName: "longhorn"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
  deletionPolicy: WipeOut
```

Let's create the `MSSQLServer` CR we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/mssqlserver/volume-expansion/mssqlserver-ag-cluster.yaml
mssqlserver.kubedb.com/mssqlserver-ag-cluster created
```

Now, wait until `mssqlserver-ag-cluster` has status `Ready`. i.e,

```bash
$ kubectl get mssqlserver -n demo mssqlserver-ag-cluster
NAME                     VERSION     STATUS   AGE
mssqlserver-ag-cluster   2022-cu12   Ready    5m1s
```

Let's check volume size from petset, and from the persistent volume,

```bash
$ kubectl get petset -n demo mssqlserver-ag-cluster -o json | jq '.spec.volumeClaimTemplates[].spec.resources.requests.storage'
"1Gi"

$ kubectl get pv -n demo
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                                STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   REASON   AGE
pvc-059f186a-01a4-441d-85f1-95aef34934be   1Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    demo/data-mssqlserver-ag-cluster-0   longhorn       <unset>                          82s
pvc-87bea35f-4a55-4aa5-903a-e4da9f548241   1Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    demo/data-mssqlserver-ag-cluster-1   longhorn       <unset>                          52s
pvc-9d1c3c9c-f928-4fa2-a2e1-becf2ab9c564   1Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    demo/data-mssqlserver-ag-cluster-2   longhorn       <unset>                          35s
```

You can see the petset has 1GB storage, and the capacity of all the persistent volumes are also 1GB.

We are now ready to apply the `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` CR to expand the volume of this database.

### Volume Expansion

Here, we are going to expand the volume of the MSSQLServer cluster.

#### Create MSSQLServerOpsRequest

In order to expand the volume of the database, we have to create a `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` CR with our desired volume size. Below is the YAML of the `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` CR that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MSSQLServerOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: mops-volume-exp-ag-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: VolumeExpansion
  databaseRef:
    name: mssqlserver-ag-cluster
  volumeExpansion:
    mode: "Offline" # Online
    mssqlserver: 2Gi
```

Here,

- `spec.databaseRef.name` specifies that we are performing volume expansion operation on `mssqlserver-ag-cluster` database.
- `spec.type` specifies that we are performing `VolumeExpansion` on our database.
- `spec.volumeExpansion.mssqlserver` specifies the desired volume size.
- `spec.volumeExpansion.mode` specifies the desired volume expansion mode (`Online` or `Offline`). Storageclass `longhorn` supports `Offline` volume expansion.

> **Note:** If the Storageclass you are using support `Online` Volume Expansion, Try Online volume expansion by using `spec.volumeExpansion.mode:"Online"`.

During `Online` VolumeExpansion KubeDB expands volume without deleting the pods, it directly updates the underlying PVC. And for Offline volume expansion, the database is paused. The Pods are deleted and PVC is updated. Then the database Pods are recreated with updated PVC.


Let's create the `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` CR we have shown above,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/example/mssqlserver/volume-expansion/mops-volume-exp-ag-cluster.yaml
mssqlserveropsrequest.ops.kubedb.com/mops-volume-exp-ag-cluster created
```

#### Verify MSSQLServer volume expanded successfully

If everything goes well, `KubeDB` Ops-manager operator will update the volume size of `MSSQLServer` object and related `PetSet` and `Persistent Volumes`.

Let's wait for `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` to be `Successful`.  Run the following command to watch `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` CR,

```bash
$ kubectl get mssqlserveropsrequest -n demo
NAME                         TYPE              STATUS       AGE
mops-volume-exp-ag-cluster   VolumeExpansion   Successful   8m30s
```

We can see from the above output that the `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` has succeeded. 

Now, we are going to verify from the `Petset`, and the `Persistent Volumes` whether the volume of the database has expanded to meet the desired state, Let's check,

```bash
$ kubectl get petset -n demo mssqlserver-ag-cluster -o json | jq '.spec.volumeClaimTemplates[].spec.resources.requests.storage'
"2Gi"

$ kubectl get pv -n demo
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                                STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   REASON   AGE
pvc-059f186a-01a4-441d-85f1-95aef34934be   2Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    demo/data-mssqlserver-ag-cluster-0   longhorn       <unset>                          29m
pvc-87bea35f-4a55-4aa5-903a-e4da9f548241   2Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    demo/data-mssqlserver-ag-cluster-1   longhorn       <unset>                          29m
pvc-9d1c3c9c-f928-4fa2-a2e1-becf2ab9c564   2Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    demo/data-mssqlserver-ag-cluster-2   longhorn       <unset>                          29m
```

The above output verifies that we have successfully expanded the volume of the MSSQLServer database.

## Standalone Mode

The volume expansion process is same for all the MSSQLServer modes. The `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` CR has the same fields. The database needs to refer to a mssqlserver 
in standalone mode.

## Cleaning Up

To clean up the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:


```bash
$ kubectl patch -n demo ms/mssqlserver-ag-cluster -p '{"spec":{"deletionPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"
mssqlserver.kubedb.com/mssqlserver-ag-cluster patched

$ kubectl delete -n demo mssqlserver mssqlserver-ag-cluster
mssqlserver.kubedb.com "mssqlserver-ag-cluster" deleted

$ kubectl delete -n demo mssqlserveropsrequest mops-volume-exp-ag-cluster
mssqlserveropsrequest.ops.kubedb.com "mops-volume-exp-ag-cluster" deleted

kubectl delete issuer -n demo mssqlserver-ca-issuer
kubectl delete secret -n demo mssqlserver-ca
kubectl delete ns demo
```
