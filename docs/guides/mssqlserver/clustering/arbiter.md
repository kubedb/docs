# Arbiter Node Support for Microsoft SQL Server Cluster with Even Nodes

## Concepts
We use [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/) to determine the leader of SQL Server Availability Group cluster. With each `mssql` container, we run a sidecar container named `mssql-coordinator` which determines the leader of the cluster both on bootstrap and in fail over scenarios.
This works very well with the clusters having odd number of nodes. Clusters with even number of nodes, we introduced an extra node named `{{db}}-arbiter`. The job of the arbiter node is to participate solely in leader election. It doesn't store any data related to mssqlserver database. However, it needs a bare minimum of 1Gi~2Gi Storage for storing WAL and Snapshots that are generated by RAFT. But the generation of WAL are not very frequent. So storage space of 2Gi is more than enough for most of the clusters.

**Here we will show how to use KubeDB to provision a SQL Server even-sized Availability Group Cluster with Arbiter Node.**


## Setup

- You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

- Now, install KubeDB cli on your workstation and KubeDB operator in your cluster following the steps [here](/docs/setup/README.md). Make sure install with helm command including `--set global.featureGates.MSSQLServer=true` to ensure MSSQLServer CRD installation.

- To configure TLS/SSL in `MSSQLServer`, `KubeDB` uses `cert-manager` to issue certificates. So first you have to make sure that the cluster has `cert-manager` installed. To install `cert-manager` in your cluster following steps [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/).


To keep things isolated, this tutorial uses a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```bash
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```



## Deploy Microsoft SQL Server Availability Group Cluster with even nodes.

First, an issuer needs to be created, even if TLS is not enabled for SQL Server. The issuer will be used to configure the TLS-enabled Wal-G proxy server, which is required for the SQL Server backup and restore operations.

### Create Issuer/ClusterIssuer

Now, we are going to create an example `Issuer` that will be used throughout the duration of this tutorial. Alternatively, you can follow this [cert-manager tutorial](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ca/) to create your own `Issuer`. By following the below steps, we are going to create our desired issuer,

- Start off by generating our ca-certificates using openssl,
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./ca.key -out ./ca.crt -subj "/CN=MSSQLServer/O=kubedb"
```
- Create a secret using the certificate files we have just generated,
```bash
$ kubectl create secret tls mssqlserver-ca --cert=ca.crt  --key=ca.key --namespace=demo 
secret/mssqlserver-ca created
```
Now, we are going to create an `Issuer` using the `mssqlserver-ca` secret that contains the ca-certificate we have just created. Below is the YAML of the `Issuer` CR that we are going to create,

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
 name: mssqlserver-ca-issuer
 namespace: demo
spec:
 ca:
   secretName: mssqlserver-ca
```

Letâ€™s create the `Issuer` CR we have shown above,
```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubedb/docs/raw/{{< param "info.version" >}}/docs/examples/mssqlserver/ag-cluster/mssqlserver-ca-issuer.yaml
issuer.cert-manager.io/mssqlserver-ca-issuer created
```


Now, Let's apply the following yaml which specifies even number of replica.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: MSSQLServer
metadata:
  name: ms-even-cluster
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "2022-cu16"
  replicas: 2
  topology:
    mode: AvailabilityGroup
    availabilityGroup:
      databases:
        - agdb1
        - agdb2
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      name: mssqlserver-ca-issuer
      kind: Issuer
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
    clientTLS: false
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mssql
          env:
            - name: ACCEPT_EULA
              value: "Y"
            - name: MSSQL_PID
              value: Evaluation
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
  deletionPolicy: WipeOut
```
An extra petset with the name `{{ dbName }}-arbiter` should be created once you apply this yaml. Which will eventually create a pod having name `{{ dbName }}-arbiter-0`.

```bash
kubectl get ms,petset,pods,secrets,issuer,pvc -n demo

```

> Note: Your PVC size for data nodes might be 1000Gi, but for most of the cases you will never need more than 2Gi storage for arbiter node.


You can check arbiter pod has only one container by getting the pod yaml.
```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo ms-even-cluster-arbiter-0 -oyaml
```

## Why do we need arbiter node?

Few of our users don't want to run 3 node cluster as this was quite expensive for them, instead they wanted to use 2 node cluster, 1 primary and 1 replica. But due to raft implementation, there was chance of split brain. So we introduced this arbiter node so that they can still have 1 primary and 1 replica cluster and not have face split brain problem.


## Cleaning up

```bash
kubectl delete ms -n demo ms-even-cluster
kubectl delete ns demo
```
