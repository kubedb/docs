# Horizontal Scaling Overview

This guide will give you an overview of how `KubeDB` Ops Manager scales up/down the number of members of a `MSSQLServer`.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MSSQLServer](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/concepts/mssqlserver.md)
  - [MSSQLServerOpsRequest](/docs/guides/mssqlserver/concepts/opsrequest.md)

## How Horizontal Scaling Process Works

The following diagram shows how `KubeDB` Ops Manager used to scale up the number of members of a `MSSQLServer` cluster. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

</figure>

The horizontal scaling process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `MSSQLServer` CR.

2. `KubeDB` provisioner operator watches for the `MSSQLServer` CR.

3. When it finds one, it creates a `PetSet` and related necessary stuff like secret, service, etc.

4. Then, in order to scale the cluster up or down, the user creates a `MSSQLServerOpsRequest` CR with the desired number of replicas after scaling.

5. `KubeDB` Ops Manager watches for `MSSQLServerOpsRequest`.

6. When it finds one, it halts the `MSSQLServer` object so that the `KubeDB` provisioner operator doesn't perform any operation on the `MSSQLServer` during the scaling process.  

7. Then `KubeDB` Ops Manager will add nodes in case of scale up or remove nodes in case of scale down.

8. Then the `KubeDB` Ops Manager will scale the PetSet replicas to reach the expected number of replicas for the cluster.

9.  After successful scaling of the PetSet's replica, the `KubeDB` Ops Manager updates the `spec.replicas` field of `MSSQLServer` object to reflect the updated cluster state.

10. After successful scaling of the `MSSQLServer` replicas, the `KubeDB` Ops Manager resumes the `MSSQLServer` object so that the `KubeDB` provisioner operator can resume its usual operations.

In the next doc, we are going to show a step-by-step guide on scaling of a MSSQLServer cluster using Horizontal Scaling.
